The **Old Wiseman** is an old Rabbibunny who can be found sitting next
to a tree and a manhole in the desert during [FunFrock's
Reign](FunFrock's_Reign "wikilink"), or on the roof of the Hacienda
serenading a snake during [Twinsen's
Oddyssey](Twinsen's_Oddyssey "wikilink"). He offers
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") lots of helpful hints.
