The **Ancestral Key** is a key that opens the locked room in the cave
behind [Twinsen's house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink").

This key was passed throughout the generations at the Heir's family,
until an ancestor of the family name [Hégésippe](Hégésippe "wikilink")
was attacked and killed by the pirate [LeBorgne](LeBorgne "wikilink")
while possessing the key. LeBorgne kept the key with him until the day
he died, and eventually hid it somewhere among his treasure. However,
until the days of [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s reign, no one had
any idea where the treasure was, as LeBorgne's log book was lost. Due to
that, many people were looking for LeBorgne's lost treasure. The story
of the key's loss is described in details in a sign outside the room.

After finding the [Book of Bù](Book_of_Bù "wikilink") in the [Temple of
Bù](Temple_of_Bù "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") hears from
the old hermit outside the temple that his family must have left
information for him in his house. Twinsen goes to his house, where he
finds the secret cave near it. Reading the sign outside the locked room,
Twinsen understands that he has to find LeBorgne's lost treasure, and
thus starts asking most of the characters he meets for information
regarding LeBorgne.

Eventually, Twinsen reaches [Maritime
Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink") in [Proxima
Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink"). By getting the museum shut and then
sneaking into it, Twinsen is able to steal the Ancestral Key from
LeBorgne's chest.

Twinsen then goes back to his house, and opens the locked room with the
key. Inside, he finds [Gawley's Horn](Gawley's_Horn "wikilink") and
[Sendell's Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink"), as well as a sign
telling him about the locations of the three [Runic
Stones](Runic_Stones "wikilink") around the planet.
