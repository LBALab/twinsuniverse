## Description

The **scientist** in the main room of [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s
[Teleportation Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink") was keeping an
eye on the central computer that preserved the Teleportation system all
over [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). Though he politely warned
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") first, he did not have any problems with
shooting at him using the pistol that he was armed with. He was killed
in the explosion that Twinsen caused by hitting the central computer.

## Role in Twinsen's Adventure

The Teleportation scientist "hinted" Twinsen to destroy the five
telepods and especially the computer in the main room of the
Teleportation Center. He warned Twinsen not to touch anything when
Twinsen infiltrated the Center. Of course this gave Twinsen the idea to
actually destroy as much as he could. After disabling the telepods he
needed to hit the central computer to make it explode and find a way
out.
