## Description

The **Rabbibunny Village man** is one of four residents in the
[Rabbibunny Village](Rabbibunny_Village "wikilink") at the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink"). He is seen standing by the
huts being attacked by a [mutant](mutant "wikilink") when
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") first enters the village.

Every time Twinsen saves the villager from the mutant, he is rewarded
with a [clover leaf](clover_leaf "wikilink"), which in turn makes this
non-important character quite helpful.

This particular [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") seems to have a
Scottish accent.
