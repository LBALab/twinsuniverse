**Julia** is a female [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") living in a
[house](Julia's_house "wikilink") in the [Old Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink")
on [Principal Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"). She owns a big
screen television, one of the only few televisions found on
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). Julia is best friend to
[Beatrice](Beatrice "wikilink"), and according to her she watches
television too much.

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") first arrives to the Old Burg, he
finds out that the local citizens are afraid of him. Julia advices him
that in order to win the people's trust, he should "clobber a
[clone](clone "wikilink")". After Twinsen does so, Julia, as well as the
rest of the town's citizens, is willing to talk to him. Julia tells
Twinsen a long story, which hints him about a [clover
box](clover_box "wikilink") located on an islet off [Peg Leg
Street](Peg_Leg_Street "wikilink"). She tells him to go to Beatrice and
ask her about it.
