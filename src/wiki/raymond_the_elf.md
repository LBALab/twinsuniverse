**Raymond the Elf** is one of two [elves](elf "wikilink") in [Little Big
Adventure 1](Little_Big_Adventure_1 "wikilink"). He looks just like [Joe
the Elf](Joe_the_Elf "wikilink"), only his clothes are coloured blue.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") finds Raymond locked in a cell in the
subway station at the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink"). A [nurse](nurse "wikilink")
in the station tells Twinsen that he captured the elf, but now does not
know what to do with it, as officially it does not exist. By killing the
nurse, Twinsen gets the [key](key "wikilink") to the cell, and is thus
able to free Raymond. As a gratitude, Raymond shows Twinsen on his
[holomap](holomap "wikilink") the location of [Clear Water
Lake](Clear_Water_Lake "wikilink"). By showing him the [Elves Club Blue
Card](Elves_Club_Blue_Card "wikilink"), Twinsen also receives from
Raymond 3 [clover leaves](clover_leaves "wikilink").

Raymond later stands on the rocky peak nearby the station, and gives
Twinsen 3 clover leaves every time he shows him the card again.
