**Mies van der Rooh** is [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s neighbour
during [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s reign. He lives with his
[father](Mies_van_der_Rooh's_father "wikilink") in a
[house](Van_der_Rooh's_residence "wikilink") in [Bug
Street](Bug_Street "wikilink"). Mies is an architect, and works on
maintaining some of FunFrock's buildings, including the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink"). He is very loyal to FunFrock,
and can't see the tyranny that FunFrock causes, because he is one of the
citizens who are better off during FunFrock's reign.

Mies van der Rooh was probably named after [Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mies_van_der_rohe), a famous
architect himself.

Twinsen goes to meet Mies van der Rooh after he finds a note from him in
a safe in [FunFrock's headquarters](FunFrock's_headquarters "wikilink").
Twinsen tells him that he is searching for the plans of the
Teleportation Center, and Mies gives him his [architect's
pass](architect's_pass "wikilink"), which Twinsen uses to enter the
building.

Some time between the events of the two games, Mies van der Rooh died
under unknown circumstances. Before his death, he rebuilt the [sewers
system](Citadel_Island_sewers "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").
