**Franco Pike Guards** are omnipresent guards of the
[Emperor](Emperor "wikilink")'s
[army](:category:Imperial_Legion "wikilink") on
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). They wield a long pike. They are seen at
any place needing minor guarding, like the
[astroport](astroport "wikilink"), the [gazogem
refinery](gazogem_refinery "wikilink"), and on many streets throughout
the entire planet. Together with [Franco
Technicians](Franco_Technician "wikilink") they build the crew of the
[Emerald Moon base](Emerald_Moon_base "wikilink").

Along with the [Esmer invasion](Esmer_invasion "wikilink") on
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") they can be seen in the streets of
[Lupin-Bourg](Lupin-Bourg "wikilink"), [Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink")
and the [secret esmer base](secret_esmer_base "wikilink").<sup>\[move to
[skaters](Franco_Skater_Green "wikilink") article\]</sup>

They are guarding the little harbour at the [Island of the
Celebration](Island_of_the_Celebration "wikilink"), and are stationed
next to [Otringal Prison](Otringal_Prison "wikilink").

When setting off an alarm in an airlock of the [Emerald Moon
base](Emerald_Moon_base "wikilink"), Twinsen is able to lure a guard
into it. He quickly takes on his space suit and opens the outer doors.
Thus the franco guard, not wearing a space suit, is sucked out of the
room into space.
