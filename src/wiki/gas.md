*This article is about the gas used for travels. For the Zeelichian
layers, see [Surface](Surface "wikilink") and
[Undergas](Undergas "wikilink")*.

**Gas** on [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") is used for running vehicles.
This substance is made of molasses, a thick and dark syrup produced
during the refining of sugar. One can of gas is needed for each trip in
a [buggy](buggy "wikilink") or in a
[hydroglider](hydroglider "wikilink"). Gas cans are available for sale
in several shops around the planet, always in packs of 10 cans. There
are also a few for free in some places, like the [water
tower](water_tower "wikilink") or the [rebel
camp](rebel_camp "wikilink").

reach several places too far to walk, such as the water tower and [Port
Belooga](Port_Belooga "wikilink") in [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"), or the rebel camp in [Rebellion
Island](Rebellion_Island "wikilink"). The gas is also used to run the
hydroglider in the [Northern
Hemisphere](Northern_Hemisphere "wikilink"), before finding
[Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink").
