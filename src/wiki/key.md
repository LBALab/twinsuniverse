**Keys** are used for opening doors and gates.
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") usually obtains them by either searching
in plants or garbage bins, or by killing a guard keeping the key. He can
take a key by either walking over it, or by throwing his [Magic
Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink") at it, as it is attracted to keys.

If Twinsen goes out of a room, he loses all the keys in his possesion,
regardless of whether the door he passes requires a key or not. The
number of keys Twinsen has is indicated in the [behavior
menu](behavior_menu "wikilink").
