The **baggage claim owner** is a nameless [grobo](grobo "wikilink") who
owns the [Baggage Claim](Baggage_Claim "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").

Twinsen can enter the baggage claim in the beginning of the game, but
has no business there first, and the owner does not let him into the
basement.

When Twinsen comes there to claim his
[proto-pack](proto-pack "wikilink"), the owner lets him in, and
instructs him how to take the proto-pack. When Twinsen or
[Carlo](Carlo "wikilink") bring the proto-pack back to the reception,
the owner opens the crate, and Twinsen can then take the proto-pack.
