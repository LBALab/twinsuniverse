**Joe the Elf** is a green [Elf](Elf "wikilink"). He has magical powers
to teleport himself, and is able to use [telepods](telepod "wikilink"),
which are supposed to work only for [clones](clone "wikilink"). He is a
member of the Elves Club and a friend of [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink").

## During FunFrock's Reign

Twinsen finds Joe in a grotto in the [White Leaf
Desert](White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink") in [Little Big Adventure
1](Little_Big_Adventure_1 "wikilink"). Joe is trapped in a labyrinth,
allegedly because he wasn't supposed to be in the game. After Twinsen
opens the entrance of the cave with the [Horn of
Gawley](Horn_of_Gawley "wikilink"), however, he is able to leave it. Joe
makes Twinsen an honorary Elf as a reward, by giving him the [Elves Club
Blue Card](Elves_Club_Blue_Card "wikilink"). With this card, Twinsen is
able to open a locked door in a small fortress in the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink").

Joe later goes out to explore the world. According to the
[horse](horse "wikilink") galloping in the desert, he is looking for a
captured princess to be rescued.

If Twinsen uses his [Flask of Clear
Water](Flask_of_Clear_Water "wikilink") in the [Water
Tower](Water_Tower "wikilink") to clear the water supply of [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"), Joe teleports in from the telepod
on top of the Water Tower, claiming that teleportation makes him
nauseous.

## During Twinsen's Odyssey

Twinsen and Joe meet again several times in [Little Big Adventure
2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"). Firstly, in the [Tralü's
cave](Tralü's_cave "wikilink"), where Joe shows his magical teleporting
power, which are not yet working all right.

They meet again in the [Cemetery](Cemetery "wikilink") in front of the
[School of Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink"). Joe is transformed into a
shell for unknown reasons. However, Twinsen is able to heal him with the
[Horn of the Blue Triton](Horn_of_the_Blue_Triton "wikilink"). Joe gives
him three [Clover leaves](Clover_Leaf "wikilink") as a reward.

Later on, Joe goes to [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") along with
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink")'s wizards. As the wizards are captured by
the forces of the [Emperor](Emperor "wikilink"), he is scared and plans
to get back to [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). On his way, he meets
Twinsen, in his [Wizard's Parade
Tunic](Wizard's_Parade_Tunic "wikilink"), at the
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink") [astroport](astroport "wikilink"). He
recognizes Twinsen and calls him by his name. The
[esmers](esmer "wikilink"), who don't yet recognize Twinsen, thus put
both of them in the [Otringal prison](Otringal_prison "wikilink").

In prison, Joe teleports himself into Twinsen's cell. He tells Twinsen
about the Esmers' plans to abduct the children of Twinsun. He also
attracts a [Franco Police Officer](Franco_Police_Officer "wikilink"),
who opens the cell's door, making it possible for Twinsen to escape the
prison. Joe himself hides in the [Esmer
shuttle](Esmer_shuttle "wikilink") that Twinsen steals, and appears
later in the crashed shuttle on the [Ridge of the Flowers
Circle](Ridge_of_the_Flowers_Circle "wikilink"). He claims he would like
to get back to Zeelich, as the wizards are left alone there now.
