**Franckie** is the owner of the [bar](Franckie's "wikilink") on the
[Island of the Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"). During the
search for the [Francos fragment](Francos_fragment "wikilink"), Franckie
doesn't participate in the treasure hunt, claiming he does not believe
in all those stories. However, being the owner of the only pub on the
island, he is able to use the search for his own benefit, and during
that period his business blossoms.

Franckie gives Twinsen a small hint, to search for clues about the lost
fragment in [Roger de la Fontaine](Roger_de_la_Fontaine "wikilink")'s
[house](Roger_de_la_Fontaine's_house "wikilink").
