The **pharmacist** is a female [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink")
running the [pharmacy](pharmacy "wikilink") in [Lupin-Bourg
East](Lupin-Bourg_East "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), during [Twinsen's
Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink"). She is the sister of
[Raph](Raph "wikilink"), the [lighthouse](lighthouse "wikilink") keeper.

After [Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink") is hit by a lightning during the
[storm](storm "wikilink"), [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink") sends
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") to the pharmacy to find a cure for him.
The pharmacist tells Twinsen that she doesn't have anything for a
Dino-Fly.

After the storm, in case Twinsen hadn't talked with
[Leone](Leone "wikilink") earlier, the pharmacist tells him that the
healing wizard [Ker'aooc](Ker'aooc "wikilink") might be able to help
him.

The [quetch guy](quetch_guy "wikilink") behind the [Weather Wizard's
Tent](Weather_Wizard's_Tent "wikilink") has a big crush on the
Pharmacist.
