## Description

This **parade tunic** is worn by the wizards from
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). It makes the owner recognizable as a
wizard. These tunics are given to anyone who graduates from the [School
of Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink"). In case the school has none left
in stock, they will be supplied by the local wizard's accessories
seller, [Chedil Amiradoo](Chedil_Amiradoo "wikilink").

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Upon graduating from the School of Magic, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")
was told about the myserious disappearance of all wizards of the planet.
Following the request of the
[rector](Rector_of_the_School_of_Magic "wikilink"), Twinsen went out to
search for them. Once graduating from the school Twinsen was able buy a
wizard's parade tunic from Chedil Amiradoo.

The [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink"), not recognizing Twinsen, thought he was
just a harmless wizard they can kidnap. Twinsen was invited to a tour
around [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), which was a cover for the Esmers'
plans of kidnapping all the wizards. None of the Esmers recognized
Twinsen, until [Joe the Elf](Joe_the_Elf "wikilink") accidently betrayed
him by revealing his true identity. Twinsen was then captured, and lost
his wizard's costume.

If it wasn't for the costume, Twinsen would not have been able to go to
Zeelich with the Esmers.
