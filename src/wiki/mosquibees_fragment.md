The **Mosquibees Fragment** is one of the four fragments which together
summon [Dark Monk's statue](Dark_Monk's_statue "wikilink") to complete
the ceremony. This turns [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") back to its
original look after 10,000 ceremonies. The Mosquibees Fragment is the
yellow "left" piece of [Dark Monk's Key](Dark_Monk's_Key "wikilink").

The fragment itself is stored inside a locked box, on an [island
isolated from the Mosquibees Village](Platform_Ring "wikilink"), to
prevent the [emperor](emperor "wikilink") and his soldiers from stealing
it.

As a part of his quest of hunting down the four key fragments,
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") reaches the [Island of the
Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink"), in a search for their
fragment. Just after he completes the [Test of
Truth](Test_of_Truth "wikilink"), the emperor's soldiers invade the
[village](Mosquibee_Village "wikilink"). Twinsen manages to escape, and
goes to the island isolated from the village, where the fragment is
found.

On the island, Twinsen finds a box in which the Mosquibees Fragment is
kept. He has to battle a [gas monster](gas_monster "wikilink") in order
to get the [key](key "wikilink") to the box. This monster is only able
to be defeated by throwing back its own fireballs with a [Wannies
Glove](Wannies_Glove "wikilink"). After Twinsen kills the monster, he
has the key to the box, and is thus able to get the fragment.
