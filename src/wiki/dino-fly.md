The **Dino-Fly** is a mythical creature, with uncertain origins. He is a
green dinosaur-like animal, with the ability to fly. When
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") finds him, he is told that he has been
waiting for him for a long time. The Dino-Fly is an asset to both of
Twinsen's Adventures.

During [FunFrock's Reign](FunFrock's_Reign "wikilink"), Twinsen is
advised by a [sphero](sphero "wikilink") upon arriving on [Tippett
Island](Tippett_Island "wikilink") that he would need the services of a
dino-fly in order to reach some of the planet's islands. Twinsen meets
the Dino-Fly at the cliff peak of Tippett Island's surface. At this
point, the Dino-Fly is only able to fly around the [northern
hemisphere](northern_hemisphere "wikilink") of the planet, due to his
soar back. Twinsen uses the Dino-Fly to reach some of the hemisphere's
islands unreachable with a [hydroglider](hydroglider "wikilink"), such
as [Brundle Island](Brundle_Island "wikilink") and [Fortress
Island](Fortress_Island "wikilink").

During [Twinsen's Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink"), Twinsen has
taken the Dino-Fly to his home on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). The adventure starts with a cutscene
of Dino-Fly injured in a [lightning storm](Storm "wikilink"), and curing
him is Twinsen's first main goal. He is eventually able to do so by
using the [Horn of the Blue Triton](Horn_of_the_Blue_Triton "wikilink"),
which he receives as part of his studies at the [School of
Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink"). Dino-Fly's main use in the second
game is taking Twinsen to the [Island of the Dome of the
Slate](Island_of_the_Dome_of_the_Slate "wikilink"), which Twinsen can't
reach with a [ferry](ferry "wikilink").
