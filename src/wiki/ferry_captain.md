The **ferry captain** is a [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") working
for the Inter-Island Ferry services as a [ferry](ferry "wikilink")
captain. Every time a ferry is ready to take off, it is his job to sail
the ferry to its desired destination, as well as conducting the
passenger's [tickets](Ferry_ticket "wikilink").

While in the [Southern Hemisphere](Southern_Hemisphere "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") travels several times from [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink") to [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink") in a ferry. When reaching the
ferry, he is encountered by the captain, who makes sure he has a ticket,
and then sails the ferry to the desired destination.

Once buying his [catamaran](catamaran "wikilink"), Twinsen finds no
further use of the ferry services, resulting in not meeting the captain
any more.
