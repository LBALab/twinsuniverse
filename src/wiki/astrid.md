**Astrid** is the queen of the [mosquibees](mosquibee "wikilink"). Not
agreeing with the [emperor](emperor "wikilink") of
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), the mosquibees have their own leader. She
has a quite high rank and status on Zeelich, just below the emperor.
Astrid is much larger than the common mosquibee and is very respected
among her fellow mosquibees.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") meets Astrid in [Mosquibee
Village](Mosquibee_Village "wikilink") on the [Island of the
Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink"), where he goes in
search for a passage to [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"). Astrid was
the holder of the [key](Key_to_the_Passage_to_CX "wikilink") and was
guarding the passage which leads there. However, not being trusted
immediately, Twinsen first has to show her the [Ring of the
Dissidents](Ring_of_the_Dissidents "wikilink"), and then has to get a
new weapon in the [Challenge room](Challenge_room "wikilink"). After
completing the mosquibees challenge, Twinsen is able to prove his
trustworthiness.

Soon after Twinsen completes the tet, the emperor's soldiers attack the
village. Twinsen gets away, but Astrid is taken by the emperor's
soldiers. After asking some survivors of the attack for assistance,
Twinsen eventually manages to find her locked in the [Building
Company](Building_Company "wikilink") at the [Island of the
Wannies](Island_of_the_Wannies "wikilink"). Knowing she has to face the
emperor sooner or later, Astrid gives Twinsen the key to the passage and
some advice.

At the end of the game, Astrid seem to amuse herself at the
victory-party on [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink").
