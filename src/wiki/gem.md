**Gems** are found in the [Gem Mines](Gem_Mine "wikilink") in the
[Island of the Wannies](Island_of_the_Wannies "wikilink"). The
[Wannies](Wannie "wikilink") mine them, and the
[Francos](Franco "wikilink") extract them into the
[Zeelichian](Zeelich "wikilink") fuel, [gazogem](gazogem "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink"), however, uses the gems for something
else; needing to travel between the islands of the
[Undergas](Undergas "wikilink"), he calls the services of the
[Ferryman](Ferryman "wikilink"), who charges passengers four gems a
trip. Twinsen collects the gems in the Wannies mines, where there is a
total of 8 gems. There are also 4 gems in the [Island of the
Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink"), and 4 in the [Island
below the Volcano](Island_below_the_Volcano "wikilink").
