**Clones** are robots created by [Dr.
FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink"), that are designed to look like a
representative of one of the [Twinsunian](Twinsun "wikilink")
[races](Category%3ASpecies "wikilink"). They are created in the Cloning
Center, which is located in the inside of [FunFrock's Secret
Fortress](FunFrock's_Secret_Fortress "wikilink"). The clones are then
sent to the [Teleportation Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink") on
[Brundle Island](Brundle_Island "wikilink"), where they can be
teleported to one of the many [telepods](telepod "wikilink") around the
planet.

Red clones have an unexplainable hatred against
[Meca-Penguins](Meca-Penguin "wikilink"). In Little Big Adventure 2, all
clones hated [Nitro-Meca-Penguins](Nitro-Meca-Penguin "wikilink").

Clones are enemies to [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") throughout Little
Big Advnture 1. He has to fight them at many different occasions. The
Supergros pose a great threat to Twinsen, as they are able to send him
to prison. The [Dr. FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink") Twinsen fought
was a clone.

In Little Big Adventure 2, Twinsen has to fight clones in [Dark Monk's
statue](Dark_Monk's_statue "wikilink").
