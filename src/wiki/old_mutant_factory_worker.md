The **old mutant factory worker** is a [grobo](grobo "wikilink") that
used to work in the [mutant factory](mutant_factory "wikilink"). He
tells [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") that he has been waiting outside the
factory for a [ferry](ferry "wikilink") home, and has apparently been
doing so for two years.
