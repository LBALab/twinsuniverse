**Itinary tokens** are used by [Zeelichians](Zeelich "wikilink") for
operating [Esmer shuttles](Esmer_shuttle "wikilink"). Without these
tokens, the shuttles can't take off. These disc-shaped tokens have to be
placed inside a device placed on any common Esmers shuttle in order to
launch them.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") first notices the
[Esmers](Esmer "wikilink") using an itinary token when going with them
to [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). When escaping the planet later,
Twinsen needs to find an itinary token for a shuttle. After escaping the
[prison](Otringal_prison "wikilink"), Twinsen runs to the control tower
in the [Astroport](Astroport "wikilink"), where he steals a token after
defeating the [Franco Pike Guards](Franco_Pike_Guard "wikilink") and
[Franco Technicians](Franco_Technician "wikilink"). After obtaining the
token, Twinsen makes his way back to a shuttle that stands at the port,
and places the travel token inside the appropriate device. Once doing
that, the shuttle takes off.

The second time Twinsen needs a token is when heading for [Emerald
Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink"). Twinsen has to steal a shuttle from the
[secret base](Esmer_base "wikilink") the Esmers had built inside the
[Temple of Bù](Temple_of_Bù "wikilink"), and travel to the moon in order
to free [Jerome Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink"). To get himself a
token, Twinsen has to defeat the [Franco Skater
Green](Franco_Skater_Green "wikilink") guarding the shuttle in order to
get the key to the elevator nearby. He then needs the
[Proto-Pack](Proto-Pack "wikilink") to fly over an electric bridge and
defeat one more Franco guard to open a spheric safe which holds the
token. On his way back Twinsen encounters one more guard, which he can
easily defeat by turning the electric bridge off and then on again.
Twinsen then takes the elevator down and enters the shuttle to head for
the moon.

The third time Twinsen needs an itinary token is when leaving [Island
CX](Island_CX "wikilink") and going back to
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"). He obtains this token from a tower very
similar to the Astroport in [Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"). Once doing
that, he has to make his way through the dangerous island, until
reaching the Emsers shuttle that stands in the corner. He can then make
his way back to Otringal, landing just next to the [Emperor's
Palace](Emperor's_Palace "wikilink").
