**Kroptman** is a firm [sphero](sphero "wikilink") rebelling against
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink") during his reign. He became the colonel
of the [rebels](rebel "wikilink") on [Rebellion
Island](Rebellion_Island "wikilink"). Kroptman was captured during their
assault on the [Okojo pass](Okojo_pass "wikilink"), which would lead
them to the [Northern hemisphere](Northern_hemisphere "wikilink") of
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink").

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") arrives to Rebellion Island he is
given the task to free the Colonel. A commando helps Twinsen to get into
the fort which guards the pass and where Kroptman is being held. Freeing
the Colonel eventually enables Twinsen to reach the Northern Hemisphere
himself.

After Kroptman is freed by [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") he escapes
together with the [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") commando that had
guided Twinsen to the fort. They both disappear.
