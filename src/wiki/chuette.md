**Chuette** is a little yellow mechanical owl that wanders around
[Franco Village](Franco_Village "wikilink") on the [Island of the
Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"). It has a small den next to
[Roger de la Fontaine's house](Roger_de_la_Fontaine's_house "wikilink").
The only thing it says is "Biddy Biddy". The [dog](dog "wikilink") that
lives on the island also dislikes the owl, because it hides in one of
it's niches.

This owl seems to be of a thieving nature, as a [franco
child](franco_child "wikilink") in the local franco
[kindergarten](kindergarten "wikilink") tells
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") it took the key to his house. Following
the owl, Twinsen arrives to his nest, where he finds the [Burgermaster's
Key](Burgermaster's_Key "wikilink"). Twinsen uses this key to open he
cupboard holding the [Burgermaster's
Notes](Burgermaster's_Notes "wikilink").

If Twinsen sets off a
[Nitro-Meca-Penguin](Nitro-Meca-Penguin "wikilink") near the owl, little
hearts float up from it.
