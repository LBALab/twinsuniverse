**Money-Monkey** is an assassin of an unknown race with four arms, who
receives orders from [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink") to track
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") down and kill him, as revealed by himself.
He sents his spies after Twinsen. As Twinsen may notice they are
eavesdropping at a conversation between him and [Johnny
Rocket](Johnny_Rocket "wikilink") at the [Imperial
Hotel](Imperial_Hotel "wikilink"), from which he figured out Twinsen
would be coming to the [Elevator Platform](Elevator_Platform "wikilink")
to the [Undergas](Undergas "wikilink"), where he waited for him.

His two attacks both will hit Twinsen very hard (8-10 lifepoints). He
throws explosive wooden crates at him from a distance as well, causing
extra damage.

When Twinsen has arrived to the elevator platform, he met the
Money-Monkey for the first time. Entering the elevator requires a
[key](key "wikilink"), so Twinsen had to kill the assassin first in
order to retrieve the key and get in.
