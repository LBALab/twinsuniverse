## Description

**Valentin** is a [Franco](Franco "wikilink") Miner, one of the many
inhabitants on the [Island of the
Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"). Just like all the other
Francos on the island, Valentin is searching for their lost [Key
Fragment](Francos_Fragment "wikilink"). He uses a dowsing pendulum to
find it.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Valentin gave [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") a clue, that the fragment
might be buried near the gas.
