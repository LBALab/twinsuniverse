The **Captain** is a nameless [Franco](Franco "wikilink") who transports
people around the islands of [Zeelich's
Surface](Zeelich's_Surface "wikilink") for the price of 10
[Zlitos](Zlitos "wikilink"). He calls his boat "Leontine".

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") crashes on
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"), his main objective is to find a way to
reach [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"). At the
[harbour](Otringal_harbour "wikilink") he finds the captain, and as all
other ferries refuse to take Twinsen to Island CX, the Captain thinks he
can help him, for an unusual fee of 100 Zlitos. He's the only one who is
able to help Twinsen, so Twinsen doesn't have much choice. Twinsen pays
him the 100 Zlitos, and the captain tells Twinsen about [a
franco](Island_CX_Survivor "wikilink") on [Celebration
Island](Celebration_Island "wikilink") who went to the island and came
back alive. He then takes Twinsen to the island for free.

When coming back from Celebration Island, Twinsen discovers why he was
attacked by the guards, and why the captain charged such a high fee, as
[Dark Monk](Dark_Monk "wikilink") has put Twinsen on the wanted list.

It's possible to use the captain's services afterwards, although he
charges twice as much for journeys as the other captains in the harbour.
