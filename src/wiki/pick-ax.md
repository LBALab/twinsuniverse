**Pick-ax** is an object used to dig in grassy areas or to extract a
piece from a hard object. It is mainly used by the
[Wannies](Wannie "wikilink"), to mine [gems](gem "wikilink").
Additionally, the [Francos](Franco "wikilink") use them to search for
their lost [fragment](Francos_fragment "wikilink"). Such axes are
available for sale at the local [bazaar](Francos_bazaar "wikilink") for
20 [Zlitos](Zlito "wikilink").

In his search for the Francos Fragment, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")
buys a pick-ax from the bazaar at the [Island of the
Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"). He uses it in order to dig
for the fragment, after finding it following the instructions on the
[Burgermaster's notes](Burgermaster's_notes "wikilink").

The second time Twinsen needs the pick-ax is after the
[Dissidents](Dissident "wikilink") give him with a [Laser
Pistol](Laser_Pistol "wikilink"). For the pistol to work, Twinsen charge
it with [rock crystal](rock_crystal "wikilink"). After digging in the
northern part of the [Island of
Celebration](Island_of_Celebration "wikilink"), Twinsen charges the
pistol with rock crystal, making it workable. Without the pistol,
Twinsen can not advance in his adventure, as the pistol is needed to
access the [harbor of the Francos](harbor_of_the_Francos "wikilink").
