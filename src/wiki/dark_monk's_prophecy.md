**Dark Monk's Prophecy** is a [Zeelichian](Zeelich "wikilink") prophecy
which tells about the origin of the planet Zeelich and Dark Monk, and
how one day Zeelich will become a beautiful planet again.

## The prophecy

The prophecy is scribed on a wall in [Dark Monk's
Temple](Dark_Monk's_Temple "wikilink") at the [Island of
Celebration](Island_of_Celebration "wikilink"):

A partial third part appears inside [Dark Monk's
Statue](Dark_Monk's_Statue "wikilink"):

## In the game

[Dr. FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink"), or a [clone](clone "wikilink")
of him, somehow escaped from [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") after his
fight with [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") and arrived on Zeelich, a grey
planet surrounded with a thick layer of gas in which monsters float
freely about and seas of lava flow underneath it. FunFrock, up for more
evil plans, made a pact with the [Emperor of
Zeelich](Emperor_of_Zeelich "wikilink"), and disguised himself as Dark
Monk, the God of Zeelich. The religious [Esmers](Esmers "wikilink")
believed everything he said and prepared a plan to destroy Twinsun,
because "Dark Monk" instructed them to do so. [Jerome
Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink") is right on time to find this out
and calls in the help of Twinsen, now the well known savior of Twinsun.

Twinsen once again takes the job of the hero to save his planet, and
travels to Zeelich. There he unmasks Dark Monk and the plan that the
Emperor was preparing, right in front of the deceived Esmers. They are
right on time to help Twinsen to stop the destruction of the planet.
During his quest, Twinsen actually assembls all four fragments of [Dark
Monk's key](Dark_Monk's_key "wikilink") and makes the prophecy of the
real Dark Monk come true. Zeelich is now once again a green paradise,
without gas or lava present on its surface.

## Unconfirmed theories

Although FunFrock took the role of Dark Monk, the prophecy of Dark Monk
must have been true for the prophecy to be fulfilled. Dark Monk probably
does exist, but never takes the form of a mortal, like FunFrock. Perhaps
all the prophecy wanted was to reunite the four races of Zeelich by
bringing together all four key fragments, which was fulfilled by Twinsen
himself, only trying to save his own planet.
