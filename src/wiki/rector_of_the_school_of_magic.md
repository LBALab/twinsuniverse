The **rector of the school of magic** is a nameless
[rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") who is in charge of the [School of
Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink"). He guides the new pupils of the
school throughout their tests, and gives them their rewards when they
complete them. He is assisted by a rabbibunny named
[Bunny](Bunny "wikilink"). Before anyone may start becoming a wizard at
the School of Magic, the rector requires them an inscription free of 120
[kashes](kashes "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink"), knowing he has to cure his
[Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink"), enrols at the School of Magic to become
a wizard, and is guided by the Rector through his tests. He says Twinsen
has to pass all three tests of Wizardry to become a Wizard, even though
he once saved the planet. The Rector gives Twinsen his rewards after
completing each of the tests: a [Blowgun](Blowgun "wikilink") after
completing the Blowgun test, the [Horn of the Blue
Triton](Horn_of_the_Blue_Triton "wikilink") after completing the test of
the [Balsam](Garden_Balsam "wikilink"), a [Magic
Slate](Magic_Slate "wikilink") for the test of the [Dome of the
Slate](Dome_of_the_Slate "wikilink") and a [Wizard's
Diploma](Wizard's_Diploma "wikilink") upon graduation.

After Twinsen completes his studies in the school, the Rector entrusts
him with the very concerning news that all the wizards of the planet
have disappeared. He asks Twinsen to go finding their trails.

After Twinsen comes back from [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"),
[Zoé](Zoé "wikilink") tells him about the kidnapping of the Twinsunian
children by the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink"), and advices him to ask for
assistance in the School of Magic. The Rector tells Twinsen that in
order to deal with the Esmers, he should first increase his magic level,
by obtaining the [Sendell's Ball](Sendell's_Ball "wikilink"). He also
tells him that he needs the [Ring of
Lightning](Ring_of_Lightning "wikilink") for that.
