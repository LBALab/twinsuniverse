## Description

The **Sups Fragment** was one of the four fragments which together
summoned [Dark Monk's Statue](Dark_Monk's_Statue "wikilink") to complete
the ceremony. This turned back [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") to its
original look after 10,000 ceremonies. The Sups Fragment is the blue
"under" piece of [Dark Monk's Key](Dark_Monk's_Key "wikilink").

The fragment was located in the back room of the [Emperor's
Palace](Emperor's_Palace "wikilink"), heavily guarded by
[Hussars](Hussars "wikilink") and an unidentified monster.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

As a part of his quest of uniting the four key fragments,
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") had to find the Sups Fragment. However, he
wasn't able to reach it, as it was located in the heavily-guarded
Emperor's Palace. After killing the [emperor](emperor "wikilink"),
Twinsen took his [sword](Emperor's_Sword "wikilink"), with which he was
able to fight his way to the fragment. Once defeating 3 guards in the
back room of the palace, Twinsen had only to defeat a two-headed monster
in order to get the key to the fragment. Twinsen took the fragment, and
had to fight his way back outside in order to complete [the
prophecy](Dark_Monk's_prophecy "wikilink").
