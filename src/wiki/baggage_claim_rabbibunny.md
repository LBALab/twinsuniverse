The **baggage claim rabbibunny** is a nameless
[rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") employed at the [Baggage
Claim](Baggage_Claim "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") meets the rabbibunny when he comes to the
baggage claim building to retrieve his
[proto-pack](proto-pack "wikilink"). If Twinsen chooses to push the
crate himself, he reaches the rabbibunny, who tells him grumpily to go
away. Hitting the rabbibunny results in him running away to a conveyor
belt that pushes him until he disappears in a hole in the wall.
