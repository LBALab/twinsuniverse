## Description

The **tavern grobo** is a [grobo](grobo "wikilink") who often visited
[Chez Luc](Chez_Luc "wikilink") in [Lupin-Burg](Lupin-Burg "wikilink")
during [FunFrock's Reign](FunFrock's_Reign "wikilink"). He could usually
be found on the first floor.

## Role in Twinsen's adventures

After [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink") had been captured by [grobo
clones](Clone "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") was looking for
clues about what happened to her. When asking around in Chez Luc, he
eventually encountered the grobo, who was willing to give Twinsen a hint
when he ordered a drink for him. After Twinsen did so, he was told that
Zoé has been to the [harbour](Citadel_Island_harbour "wikilink") in
order to get taken to another island. So Twinsen got up to get to the
harbour himself.
