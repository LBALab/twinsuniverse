**Bob Vortix** is a [sphero](sphero "wikilink") astronomer living in the
[Old Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink") on [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"). He was placed under house arrest
because he knew too much about [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s
tyranny. Due to his knowledge, he has gained respect from the citizens
living on Principal Island.

During his house arrest, [Bob's house](Bob_Vortix's_house "wikilink") is
heavily guarded by several [grobo clones](grobo_clone "wikilink"), who
are probably afraid of people trying to reach him, thus gaining some of
his knowledge.

In his search for information about [Legend of
Sendell](Legend_of_Sendell "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")
reaches the Old Burg, where he hears from many citizens about the mass
information the astronomer is able to give him. Following the citizens
of the Old Burg, Twinsen eventually reaches Bob's house.

Inside the house, Twinsen hears from Bob that the legend can be a key in
FunFrock's weakness. Bob suggests Twinsen to go to
[Port-Belooga](Port-Belooga "wikilink"), and tell the
[fisherman](fisherman "wikilink") that he (Bob) sent him. Bob also opens
a chest in his house for Twinsen, containing a high sum of kashes.

When searching for information about [LeBorgne](LeBorgne "wikilink"),
Twinsen can come back to Bob's house. Bob then suggests him to go look
in the local [bazaar](Principal_Island_bazaar "wikilink") for
information about the pirate.
