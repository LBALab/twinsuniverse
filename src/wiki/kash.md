**Kashes** are the currency unit on [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). They
are used by the inhabitants of the planet to buy items they want. Kashes
can be easily found almost anywhere around the planet, by searching
rubbish cans or plants.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") uses Kashes in order to buy anything he is
interested in. Once arriving on [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), he finds
no further use for them, and sells them to the [Twinsunian Souvenir
Shop](Twinsunian_Souvenir_Shop "wikilink"), in exchange for
[Zlitos](Zlito "wikilink").
