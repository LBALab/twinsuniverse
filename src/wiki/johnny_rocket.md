**Johnny Rocket** is a [Sup](Sup "wikilink") living on
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"). He is one of the
[Esmers](Esmer "wikilink") that come to [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink")
from [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), and the first one to set foot on
Twinsun. Although he helps the [Emperor](Emperor "wikilink") and
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink") this way, he is completely against their
acts and ideas, and therefore helps the
[dissidents](dissidents "wikilink") rebelling against them.

Johnny lives in the [Imperial Hotel](Imperial_Hotel "wikilink"), at the
[upper city](upper_city "wikilink") of Otringal. He also seems to be the
only Esmer who can speak the Twinsunian language, possibly with the aid
of a [translator](translator "wikilink").

When the Esmers land on [Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"),
Johhny gives a speach about how they come in peace. He later goes back
to Zeelich, although this is not witnessed.

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") searches for information about
[Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink") on his adventure on Zeelich, he meets
[Rick](Rick "wikilink"), who sends him to meet Johnny Rocket at the
Imperial Hotel. When Twinsen meets him there, he absent-mindedly
mentions the dissidents out loud. Johnny yells at him, and asks him to
come to his room where they can talk without danger. In his room, Johnny
tells Twinsen that he is unable to help him, and sends him to talk with
the dissidents in the [Twinsunian Souvenir
Shop](Twinsunian_Souvenir_Shop "wikilink"). He also gives Twinsen the
[Ring of the Dissidents](Ring_of_the_Dissidents "wikilink"), which is
their identification sign.
