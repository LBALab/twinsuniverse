## Description

**The Ball of Sendell** enables the person who possesses it to be
contacted by [Sendell](Sendell "wikilink"). It also promotes the level
of magic, presenting the possessor with the [red
ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink").

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Before he met [Jerome Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink") on [Emerald
Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") first had
to reach a new level of magic, to be able to defeat the
[esmers](esmers "wikilink"). In order to get it, Twinsen needed to have
a [Lightning Spell](Lightning_Spell "wikilink"), which he obtained once
adding the [Pearl of Incandescence](Pearl_of_Incandescence "wikilink")
into the [Weather Wizard](Weather_Wizard "wikilink")'s cauldron. Twinsen
then went to the hidden room in the [Citadel Island
sewers](Citadel_Island_sewers "wikilink"), at [Green Corulla
Street](Green_Corulla_Street "wikilink"). There, he needed a
[Pyramid-Shaped Key](Pyramid-Shaped_Key "wikilink") in order to open the
door where the ball was hidden. Once obtained, this magical sphere
raised Twinsen's level of magic a step higher.

## Unconfirmed theories

It is possible that Sendell's Ball also appeared in Twinsen's first
adventure. The last room of the [Well of
Sendell](Well_of_Sendell "wikilink"), where Twinsen battled
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink") for the second time, had a ball in which
Twinsen could watch some of the milestones of his odyssey. This sphere
that was included in the room could have possibly also been Sendell's
Ball from his second adventure.
