**Fire-Flies** live close to lava and in warm caves. Like the
[bats](bat "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") will get hurt if
he runs into a fire-fly, but they often give Twinsen a [clover
leaf](clover_leaf "wikilink") or much life-/magicpoints if he manages to
kill one. Fire-flies are also the main ingredient of the Wannie's very
tasty [Slice of Tart](Slice_of_Tart "wikilink").

On their own fire-flies won't attack, but will hit Twinsen once when he
walks in their path. He can be hit by 1 or 2 lifepoints.
