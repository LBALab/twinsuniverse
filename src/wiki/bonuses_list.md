The **Bonuses List** is a small note listing some of the locations of
[clover box](clover_box "wikilink") and clover leaves in
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). The note is as follows:

This list is owned by [Lanktir](Lanktir "wikilink"), a
[grobo](grobo "wikilink") residing near the
[bazaar](Proxima_Island_bazaar "wikilink") in
[Proxim-City](Proxim-City "wikilink").

By returning Lanktir the [coffee pot](coffee_pot "wikilink") on behalf
of the [sphero](sphero "wikilink") he meets near the [Maritime
Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink"), Twinsen receives this list as a
reward. With it, Twinsen is able to know the locations of some clover
boxes and clover leaves around the planet, thus being able to find them
more easily.
