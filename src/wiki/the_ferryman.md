**The Ferryman** is a myth to most of the people of the
[Undergas](Zeelich's_Undergas "wikilink"), but few actually know of his
true existance. He takes [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") across the lava
to the other islands of the undergas. The Ferryman's price for each trip
is four [gems](gem "wikilink").

## Description

Down under [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink")'s gas layer is the undergas, a
zone full of lava. The islands of the undergas are isolated from each
other. The most common myth among the dwellers of the undergas is about
a ferryman, who takes people from one island to another for a charge.
However, very few people know that the ferryman actually exists, and
even less people know how to call him. One of the few people who know
about the ferryman is a [wannie who works as a maid](Annie "wikilink")
at [Mr. Monk](Mr._Monk "wikilink")'s
[house](Mr._Lemoine's_house "wikilink"). She will teach whoever is
interested the [Ferryman's Song](Ferryman's_Song "wikilink"), which is
the song required to call the ferryman. The person singing this song at
the wharf at [Ferryman's Lane](Ferryman's_Lane "wikilink") on the
[Island of the Wannies](Island_of_the_Wannies "wikilink"), the beach at
[Mosquibees Island](Mosquibees_Island "wikilink") or the edge of the
[Island of the Volcano](Island_of_the_Volcano "wikilink") will be met by
the ferryman, who will then charge four gems for a trip. The ferryman
will take whoever can meet the price around the undergas. The traveler
can choose between any of each the two other locations. However, the
ferrymanâ€™s character is very obscure. Very few is known about his
personality, and it is rumored that he is a rather unfriendly wannie.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

During his adventure around Zeelich, Twinsen arrived at the undergas,
where his main goal was to reach [Mosquibee
Village](Mosquibee_Village "wikilink") so that he could access [Island
CX](Island_CX "wikilink"). Wandering around the Wannies Island, he
reached the [Wannies Village](Wannies_Village "wikilink"), where he met
Mr. Monk's maid. The maid was friendly, and helped Twinsen by teaching
him the Ferryman's Song. Twinsen then made his way to the wharf at
Ferryman's Lane, where he sang the song. In no time at all, the ferryman
arrived, and asked Twinsen for his destination. Twinsen replied he must
go to Island CX, and paid the ferryman the required amount of gems-
four. The ferryman then took him to the Mosquibees Island, where he
could continue his adventure. Later on, in his escape from the
[Emperor](Emperor "wikilink")'s attack on the island, Twinsen used the
ferryman's services again to get to the Volcano Island, and from there
to the Wannies Island.
