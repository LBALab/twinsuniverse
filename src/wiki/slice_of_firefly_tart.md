## Description

The **Firefly Tart** is a food product made and eaten by the
[Wannies](Wannie "wikilink"). It is made from the fireflies easily found
around their island.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Searching for a way to reach the [Mosquibees
Island](Mosquibees_Island "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")
reached the [Village of the Wannies](Village_of_the_Wannies "wikilink").
There, a note written by [Annie](Annie "wikilink"), the housemaid of
[Dark Monk's priest](Mr._Lemoine "wikilink"), clued the
[quetch](quetch "wikilink") to ask the priest about it. Unfortunately,
the door to [the chapel](Dark_Monk's_chapel "wikilink") leading to the
priest's house was locked. However, Twinsen was lucky enough to meet an
old wannie at the village. This wannie owned the [key](key "wikilink")
to the door, and was willing to give it to Twinsen in return for a slice
of firefly tart.

Searching for such a tart, Twinsen arrived at the house of a small
family living in the village. Being kind enough, the wannies invited
Twinsen to share their meal. After fainting once hearing what it was he
has just eaten, Twinsen took a slice of the tart for the old wannie, who
in return gave the quetch the key to the chapel.
