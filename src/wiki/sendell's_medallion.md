## Description

As described in the sacred [Book of Bù](Book_of_Bù "wikilink"),
**Sendell's Medallion** is one of the four important magical symbols
that have to be collected by the Heir, along with the [flask of Clear
Water](flask_of_Clear_Water "wikilink"), the [Ancestral
Tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink"), and the book itself. Upon gathering
and uniting those four magical symbols, the Heir's victory would be much
more certain. Furthermore, this medallion also enables upgrading the
level of magic, depending on the previous level the Chosen One had.

Additionally, this medallion was one of the signs with which
[Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink") is supposed to recognize the Heir, at
the day the latter will locate his whereabouts.

The medallion itself is made of pure gold, and is coloured as such. A
big, brown S is sealed at at the centre of the medallion, to symbolize
the close connection to [Sendell](Sendell "wikilink").

## Role in Twinsen's adventures

In his quest of defeating the evil tyrant
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") has
discovered a hidden cave just behind [his
house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink"). Once opening the door, with the aid
of the [key](Key_to_the_Heir's_room "wikilink") he stole from
[LeBorgne](LeBorgne "wikilink")'s treasure, Twinsen has reached an
enchanted room. There, at the middle, hovered in air two highly desired
magical objects: the [Horn of Gawley](Horn_of_Gawley "wikilink") and
Sendell's Medallion. Not wasting time, he quickly grabbed these two
items, thus upgrading his level of magic to Red Ball. From then on,
regardless of his general outfit, Twinsen almost always had the
medallion on. When reaching Dino-Fly at [Tippett
Island](Tippett_Island "wikilink"), the dino could recognize Twinsen as
the Heir by this medallion.

At the end of his first adventure, Twinsen has contributed the
medallion, as well as a few other objects he possesed, to [Ms. Bloop's
museum](Ms._Bloop's_museum "wikilink"). However, he very quickly found
the use of it useful again, and had to use his tricks in order to
"steal" it from the museum.

## Unconfirmed theories

The origins of the medallion are unknown. It was most likely created in
some magical way, perhaps by Sendell, and was stored for generations by
Twinsen's ancestors in the Heir's Room behind his house.
