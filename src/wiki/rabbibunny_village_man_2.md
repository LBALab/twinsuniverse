## Description

The **Rabbibunny Village man** is one of four residents of the
[Rabbibunny Village](Rabbibunny_Village "wikilink") in the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink").

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") first reaches the village, he finds
this rabbibunny standing at the edge of the village, by a car track that
leads to the [Mutant Factory](Mutant_Factory "wikilink"). He is
constantly being attacked by a [mutant](mutant "wikilink"), and whenever
Twinsen saves him from the mutant he is rewarded with a [clover
leaf](clover_leaf "wikilink").

After Twinsen destroys the Mutant Factory this villager can be seen
walking up and down the carrot garden in the village. He gives Twinsen a
clue of the location of the [Clear Water
Lake](Clear_Water_Lake "wikilink") by saying it is very near the
village.
