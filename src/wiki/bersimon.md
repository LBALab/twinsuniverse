**Bersimon**, often referred to as **The Weather Wizard** is a weather
wizard who lives in a [tent](Weather_Wizard_tent "wikilink") on the
[cliffs](cliffs "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). He is a fully qualified wizard, who
graduated from the [School of Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink").

The Weather Wizard spends most of his time, frantic about the missing
lighthouse keeper and his boiling cauldron. He informs
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") that he cannot stop the storm until he
gains access to the lighthouse but the lighthouse keeper is nowhere to
be found.

A poster on his wall says Bersimon has reached the rank of Grand Master
of sea winds and tornadoes. The Weather Wizard is thereby the only one
capable of dispursing the [storm](storm "wikilink") that prevents
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") from going to [Desert
Island](Desert_Island "wikilink"). However, he has to stand at a high
point in order to utter a conjuration, and the
[lighthouse](lighthouse "wikilink") is the only available place at the
island. After Twinsen frees [Raph](Raph "wikilink"), the lighthouse
keeper, Bersimon will be able to stop the storm. Then, finally capable
of landing, the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink") will land on the planet.

Bersimon also once hid [Sendell's Ball](Sendell's_Ball "wikilink") in a
cage of ice in the [sewers](Citadel_Island_sewers "wikilink"). He
already made a potion, which only needs a [Pearl of
Incandescence](Pearl_of_Incandescence "wikilink") to become ready for
use, for freeing the ball.
