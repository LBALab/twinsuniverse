**Grap** is a [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") serving as the
lieutenant of the [rebels](rebel "wikilink") on [Rebellion
Island](Rebellion_Island "wikilink"). Grap's [buggy](buggy "wikilink")
serves the rebels as a transportation method between the island's
[harbour](Rebellion_Island_harbour "wikilink") and the [rebel
camp](rebel_camp "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") meets Grap in a trench in Rebellion
Island, and hears from him that the island is constantly bobmed. Grap
tells Twinsen that he can take his buggy to reach the rebel camp.
