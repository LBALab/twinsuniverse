**Dr. FunFrock** is the main antagonist of [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")
and his allies. He was a rather big [Quetch](Quetch "wikilink") and the
dictator of [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"), before Twinsen stopped his
influence. He later disguised himself as [Dark
Monk](Dark_Monk "wikilink"), the supposedly reincarnated god of
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). His main goal was to get godlike powers.
He beliefed to get them from the power of [Sendell](Sendell "wikilink")
and the [Stellar Entity](Stellar_Entity "wikilink") inside Twinsun.

## During "FunFrock's Reign"

During his dictatorship, he made use of his knowledge of cloning and
teleporting to ensure total control of the planet's citizens. His
[clones](clones "wikilink") of all races could be teleported to all
places of [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") instantly through a network of
[telepods](telepod "wikilink"). These technologies were controlled by
the [Teleportation Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink") and the
Cloning Center that was inside his [secret
fortress](FunFrock's_Secret_Fortress "wikilink").

He built prisons all over the planet to hold any dissidents captive,
including the massive [Citadel](Citadel "wikilink"), giving the name to
[Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). Alternately, people could
be forced under house arrests, indicated by bricked up entrance doors.

He also evacuated the [Northern
Hemisphere](Northern_Hemisphere "wikilink") in order to ensure his plans
to dig a hole to the center of Twinsun starting from [Polar
Island](Polar_Island "wikilink") in order to gain god powers. To
evacuate the hemisphere, he produced mutants in his [Mutant
Factory](Mutant_Factory "wikilink") to scare the citizens away.

FunFrock was the tyrant the [Legend of
Sendell](Legend_of_Sendell "wikilink") spoke of.
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink"), as the heir the prophecy spoke of,
destroys FunFrock's regime in his first adventure. He first meets
FunFrock, or possibly a clone of him, inside [FunFrock's
Headquarters](FunFrock's_Headquarters "wikilink") on [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"). However, FunFrock quickly
teleports himself away via the nearby [telepod](telepod "wikilink").

After Twinsen destroys both the [Mutant
Factory](Mutant_Factory "wikilink") and the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink"), he is trapped by FunFrock when
trying to rescue a clone of [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink") in [FunFrock's Secret
Fortress](FunFrock's_Secret_Fortress "wikilink"). The secret fortress
was built around the [Stone of the
Serpentaion](Stone_of_the_Serpentaion "wikilink"), the last [runic
stone](runic_stone "wikilink") of the prophecy. After Twinsen escapes
the fortress's prison, he finds the runic stone, and destroys the
fortress using the power of his [Clear
Water](Flask_of_Clear_Water "wikilink").

Twinsen faces FunFrock again on the rocky peak in the center of Polar
Island. After a short battle, FunFrock falls off the rock, and Twinsen
estimates he was defeated. FunFrock then sets off a clone of him, which
battles Twinsen again deeper in [Sendell's
Well](Sendell's_Well "wikilink").

## During "Twinsen's Odyssey"

FunFrock himself found a way to [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") and made a
second plan to destroy Twinsun, along with the Zeelichian
[Emperor](Emperor "wikilink"). They built reactors on [Emerald
Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink") to fire the moon towards Twinsun.
FunFrock disguised himself as [Dark Monk](Dark_Monk "wikilink"), a god
of Zeelich, and manipulated the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink") to help him
with his plan.

FunFrock abducts the wizards and children of Twinsun and brings them
inside [Dark Monk's statue](Dark_Monk's_statue "wikilink"). The statue
itself should be the antenna to attract the power of Sendell when
Twinsun explodes.

However, FunFrock is once again stopped by Twinsen in the last minute.
Twinsen defeats FunFrock and several of his clones in the statue, and
the Esmers destroy the lunar reactors right before the moon's impact on
Twinsun.
