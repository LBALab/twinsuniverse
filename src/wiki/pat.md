**Pat** is a [quetch](quetch "wikilink") working as a musician. She is
best friends with [Fab](Fab "wikilink") and [Raph](Raph "wikilink"), who
together formed a band. They all like hanging out at [Chez
Luc](Chez_Luc "wikilink"). The three of them started a band and they are
seen in Chez Luc wondering where their buddy, Raph has dissappeared to.
She loves to dance and can be caught saying, "Hey, we need some music
here!" while in the pub.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") can ask her about Raph the
[lighthouse](lighthouse "wikilink") keeper, but he doesn't get much of
an answer. If Twinsen puts some music on in the jukebox in the pub, Pat
comes down and starts dancing to it.
