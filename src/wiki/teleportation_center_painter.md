## Description

The **Teleportation Center painter**, whose name is unknown, was in
charge of doing some left painting work for
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink"). His main task was to paint
over the symbol of [Sendell](Sendell "wikilink") that kept reappearing
on the wall.

## Role in Twinsen's Adventure

After [Mies van der Rooh](Mies_van_der_Rooh "wikilink") had hinted on
the weak point of the Teleportation Center on the left side of the
building, the Teleportation Center painter gave
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") the final hint to his way of entrance to
the well protected building. Twinsen had to blow the [Horn of
Gawley](Horn_of_Gawley "wikilink") in front of the Sendell symbol on the
wall in order to get inside the building.
