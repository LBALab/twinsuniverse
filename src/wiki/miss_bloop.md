**Miss Bloop** is a female [grobo](grobo "wikilink") owning a
[musem](Miss_Bloop's_Private_Museum "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). This museum is dedicated to
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") and his [first
adventure](FunFrock's_Reign "wikilink"). She keeps [Twinsen's
tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink") and [Sendell's
Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink") in a safe display stand.

After the events of FunFrock's Reign, Twinsen lent his Tunic and
Medallion to Miss Bloop's museum. When he needs them again at the start
of [Twinsen's Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink"), he goes to the
museum to fetch them. There, he learns from Miss Bloop that the door to
the control room of the museum is jammed, and thus the tunic and the
medallion cannot be reached. Twinsen can only retrieve the tunic and
medaillion by using the open window on the upper floor. It leads to the
otherwise closed room with two switches. One switch opens the door, the
other opens the display stand. After Twinsen manages to open the door
and take his belongings, Miss Bloop gives him a hint regarding the
tunic, saying that the trajectory of the [Magic
Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink") changes with his
[behaviour](behaviour "wikilink").
