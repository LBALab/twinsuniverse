**Flying [Grobo](Grobo "wikilink") [Clones](Clone "wikilink")** are
found in one part of [LBA 1](LBA_1 "wikilink"). They are very fast, as
they fly around with a sort of jet-pack. They cause a lot of damage and
are hard to escape. They are found in a room rather like a large empty
swimming pool, underground at [Fortress
Island](Fortress_Island "wikilink").
