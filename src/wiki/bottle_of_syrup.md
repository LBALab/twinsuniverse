The **Bottle of Syrup** is a bottle containing 1/2 liter of
cherry-flavored syrup, used for either curing purposes, or just for
flavour.

Needing to change the water flavour in [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"), [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") goes
to the [pharmacy](pharmacy "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink") to take this syrup. He then goes to
the [Water Tower](Water_Tower "wikilink") of Principal Island, and by
pouring the syrup into the water tank, he changes the water's flavour.
In return to doing so, the [librarian](librarian "wikilink") lets
Twinsen into the Restricted Section of the
[library](library "wikilink"), where Twinsen reads about [the
legend](the_legend "wikilink").

Later in the game, Twinsen fills the now empty flask with the [Clear
Water](Flask_of_Clear_Water "wikilink").
