The **pharmacist** is a [quetch](quetch "wikilink") running the [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink") [pharmacy](pharmacy "wikilink")
during the reign of [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink").

It has been suspected by fans that he is the "informant" the
[nurse](nurse "wikilink") in the [Citadel](Citadel "wikilink") is
talking about, and thus is maybe responsible for
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s arrest.

When Twinsen comes to the pharmacy to get a bottle of [cherry
syrup](cherry_syrup "wikilink"), it is obvious that the pharmacist fears
Twinsen, as he is very scared when he sees that Twinsen had managed to
escape the Citadel. The pharmacist manages to call a [grobo
clone](grobo_clone "wikilink") using his alarm button, but is eventually
killed by Twinsen.
