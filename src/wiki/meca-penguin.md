**Meca-Penguin** is one of the weapons available in [Little Big
Adventure 1](Little_Big_Adventure_1 "wikilink"). Once winded up, these
small penguins move slowly across the floor. Red
[clones](clone "wikilink") are attracted to these penguins, and when
they see one, they leave their guard and go beating up the penguin. It
can therefore be used as a distraction method against them.

Meca-Penguins are available in some shops around
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). Additionally, [rebels](rebels "wikilink")
at [Rebellion Island](Rebellion_Island "wikilink") use them as practice
targets. There is also one room in the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink") full of Meca-Penguins, which is
accessible with a [keypad](keypad "wikilink"). However, this room is not
really effective, as it is only possible to possess one Meca-Penguin at
a time.

Meca-Penguins never play a vital part in completing the game. However,
they can come in handy when needing to get past red clones, for example
in the entrance to [FunFrock's
headquarters](FunFrock's_headquarters "wikilink") in [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink").

In [Little Big Adventure 2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"), the
Meca-Penguins are replaced with
[Nitro-Meca-Penguins](Nitro-Meca-Penguin "wikilink"), which explode
instead of being beaten up.
