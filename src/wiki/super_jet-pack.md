## Description

With the [gazogem](gazogem "wikilink") as fuel, the
[Proto-Pack](Proto-Pack "wikilink") transforms into a **Super
Jet-pack**. This enables flying higher and faster than with the
proto-pack, as well as boarding from less shallow locations.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Since the elevators to the [Upper City](Upper_City "wikilink") were
temporarily out of order, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") was not able to
meet [Johnny Rocket](Johnny_Rocket "wikilink") at the [Imperial
Hotel](Imperial_Hotel "wikilink"). The only way there was via a small
river that was too high for the simple proto-pack. Fortunately enough
for Twinsen, [Jerome Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink") said he could
improve his proto-pack with the little help of a can of gazogem. The
super-jet-pack itself had no vital role thereafter, as in most places
the proto-pack would have sufficed. However, Twinsen did find it handy
at certain points in his adventure, for example at the [Island of
Celebration](Island_of_Celebration "wikilink"), when making his way to
the [rock crystal](rock_crystal "wikilink"), or in the [Island below the
Celebration](Island_below_the_Celebration "wikilink"), going to the
[secret mosquibee hideout](secret_mosquibee_hideout "wikilink").
