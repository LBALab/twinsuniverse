**Quetch** is one of the four main species of the planet
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). Their shape resembles humand, and they
are characterized by a pony tail haircut.

Quetches are scattered on various islands around the planet, and are not
concentrated in one place.

It is among the quetches that [Sendell](Sendell "wikilink") implanted a
line of chosen ones, capable of rising up if required to defend the
planet. [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink"), the hero of the [Little Big
Adventure](Little_Big_Adventure "wikilink") series, is a quetch who
discovers that he is the chosen one destined to defeat the tyrant [Dr.
FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink").
