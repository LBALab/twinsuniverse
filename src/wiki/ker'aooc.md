**Ker'aooc** is a [sphero](sphero "wikilink") wizard living in
[Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink") on the [Island of the White Leaf
Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"). He is often
referred to as the **healing wizard**. A sphero named
[Leone](Leone "wikilink") is working for him. Additinally,
[Anatole](Anatole "wikilink") is one of his regular customers.

In a search for a cure for his [Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") meets Leone in the
[pharmacy](pharmacy "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). She advices him to go meet Ker'aooc
in [his house](Ker'aooc's_house "wikilink") in Desert Island. When
Twinsen arrives to Desert Island, he finds out that Ker'aooc is not
home. Leone tells him that she is worried about that, becuase he usually
doesn't disappear for too long. Twinsen later finds out that Ker'aooc,
together with the other [wizards](wizards "wikilink") of the planet,
went with the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink") to
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), as an exchange trip. Leone tells Twinsen
that if it's an emergency, he can try finding the [School of
Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink").

Twinsen later frees Ker'aooc, among the other wizards, from the machine
in [Dark Monk's statue](Dark_Monk's_statue "wikilink").
