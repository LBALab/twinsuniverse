## Description

The **snowboard** can be used in the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink") to slide down from snowy
mountains. An excellent place for this is the [ski
summit](ski_summit "wikilink"), which also has a ski lift and marked
routes for convenience.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Exhausting in the high ranges of the Hamalayi Mountains,
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") received a snowboard from the
[Kamis](Kami "wikilink"). He could then slide down from the hills,
especially around the ski summit of the mountains. To do so, he had to
stand between one of the four pairs of flags. The snowboard did not
serve any further purpose in Twinsen's adventure.
