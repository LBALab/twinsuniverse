The **ferry ticket clerk** is a [quetch](quetch "wikilink") working as a
[ticket](ferry_ticket "wikilink") seller for the Inter-Island Ferries in
the [Harbour](Citadel_Island_harbour "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").

Every time [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") wants to board a
[ferry](ferry "wikilink") from Citadel Island in [Little Big Adventure
2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"), he must go into the Ferry
building, and buy a ticket from the seller. If Twinsen goes to the
tickets office before learning from [Leone](Leone "wikilink") that he
should go to [Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink"), then the clerk
recommends him to read the poster advertising the [Temple of
Bu](Temple_of_Bu "wikilink"). Before reading the poster, it's not
possible to choose to buy a ferry ticket.

The clerk has an assisitant behind the counter with him, named [Mrs.
Brune](Mrs._Brune "wikilink").
