The **Ring of the Dissidents** is a ring used as an identification sign
of the [Zeelichian](Zeelich "wikilink")
[dissidents](dissident "wikilink"), the small group opossing the
[Emperor](Emperor "wikilink") and [Dark Monk](Dark_Monk "wikilink").
This ring is a proof that the owner is to be trusted by them.

In the conversation with [Johnny Rocket](Johnny_Rocket "wikilink") in
the [Imperial Hotel](Imperial_Hotel "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") receives from him the Dissidents Ring,
which Johnny instructs him to show to the seller at the [Twinsunian
Souvenir Shop](Twinsunian_Souvenir_Shop "wikilink"). After Twinsen shows
him the ring, the seller opens a secret door in his shop, which leads
down to the basement. There, Twinsen meets the dissidents, who instruct
him about finding [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink").

Later, in the [Island of the
Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink"),
[Astrid](Astrid "wikilink") asks Twinsen for a proof of his good
intentions. Twinsen does so by showing her the ring.

If [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") shows the ring to the clerk of the
[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop](Twinsunian_Souvenir_Shop "wikilink") after
returning from [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"), the Clerk turns out to
be an imposter, and shouts for the
[guards](Franco_Laser_Soldier "wikilink").
