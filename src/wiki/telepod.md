## Description

**Telepods** are devices used for teleportation. They were found all
over [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") during [Dr.
FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink")'s regime. All telepods are connected
to the [Teleportation Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink"), from
where [clones](clone "wikilink") can be sent to any place of the planet
in a matter of seconds. Telepods are also found inside [Dark Monk's
Statue](Dark_Monk's_Statue "wikilink").

It is said that only clones can use telepods and they are dangerous for
all species. However, FunFrock himself (or clones of him) uses the
telepods several times. As well, [Elves](Elf "wikilink") seem to be
attracted to telepods and get teleported to them against their will.

Telepods can be destroyed with the enhanced
[Nitro-Meca-Penguins](Nitro-Meca-Penguin "wikilink"), but not with
Meca-Penguins.

## Role in Twinsen's Adventures

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") had to avoid telepods several times during
his first adventure, as [Supergros](Supergro "wikilink") could come out
of them, sending him to prison. He also had to defeat clones who came
out of telepods several times. After he had destroyed the Teleportation
Center, the telepods were no longer working, and stopped being a threat
to Twinsen.

During his second adventure, in [Dark Monk's
Statue](Dark_Monk's_Statue "wikilink"), Twinsen also had to defeat some
clones from telepods to open a locked entrance.
