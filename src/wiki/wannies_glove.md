## Description

The **wannie's glove** isn't actually meant to be a weapon. It gives the
person who wears it protection against fire or lava. It is commonly used
by the [wannies](wannie "wikilink") inside the [mines](mines "wikilink")
on the [Island of the Wannies](Island_of_the_Wannies "wikilink"). It
allows them to pick up [gems](gem "wikilink") from the lava.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") could only use the Wannies Glove against
enemies throwing fire balls. Therefore, this glove wasn't effective
against much enemies. With it, Twinsen could throw the fire balls back
at his enemies.

This glove was found by the young [quetch](quetch "wikilink") on the
Wannies Island.

The glove itself had only one role in Twinsen's adventure. To receive
the [Mosquibees Fragment](Mosquibees_Fragment "wikilink"), the quetch
had to defeat a monster from the gas, who was the keeper of the
[key](key "wikilink") to the chest where the fragment was stored. This
walrus-like monster from the gas could only be defeated with the
wannie's glove. After a few trials at the arena, Twinsen was able to
develop the right tactics against the monster, defeat it, and retrieve
the key.

## Trivia

The Wannie's Glove was found in two different locations: inside the home
of one wannie family, and somewhere within the mines.
