The **emperor's sword** is the sword of the [Emperor of
Zeelich](Emperor_of_Zeelich "wikilink"). It is one of the strongest
weapons available on either [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") or
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink").

After killing the emperor, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") gets his sword
by openning the chest in the middle of the room using the
[key](key "wikilink") the emperor left behind him. The sword's
behaviour, just like the [Magic Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink"), changes
according to Twinsen's behavior:

- **Normal**: Twinsen hits the enemy by walking forward and cutting.
- **Sporty**: Twinsen jumpes back once and then forwards to hit the
  enemy.
- **Agressive**: Twinsen actes extremer than in Normal mode, and also
  jumps and turns a couple of times at the enemy.
- **Discreet**: Twinsen uses the sword as silent as possible. He also
  acts the least aggresive.

Twinsen can immediately test the sword, as an [hussars
guard](hussars_guard "wikilink") comes down the elevator as soon as the
sword is in his possession. This is the only weapon which can defeat the
guards at the palace, [Ring of Lightning](Ring_of_Lightning "wikilink")
inclusive. Without it, Twinsen is not able to enter the [Emperor's
Palace](Emperor's_Palace "wikilink") in his search for the [Sups
Fragment](Sups_Fragment "wikilink").
