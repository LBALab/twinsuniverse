**Baldino's Spaceship** is a spaceship created by [Jerome
Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink"). It is a long, grey ship. It has
some windows on its sides. Its side door automatically opens when
someone approaches it.

It can run with [Twinsunian fuel](Gas "wikilink") or
[gazogem](Can_of_Gazogem "wikilink").

The spaceship is the first spacecraft created by a
[Twinsunian](Twinsun "wikilink"). It was developed secretly by Baldino
at his home in [Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink") and stored under a
giant tarpaulin next to his
[house](Jerome_Baldino's_residence "wikilink"). Baldino created the
plans for it on his blackboard.

several times during Little Big Adventure 2.

Shortly before the children of Twinsun are kidnapped by the
[Esmers](Esmers "wikilink") at the [Ridge of the Flowers
Circle](Ridge_of_the_Flowers_Circle "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), Baldino notices "strange things" on
[Emerald Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink") with his powerful telescope.
Alarmed, he uses his spaceship to get to the [Emerald Moon
base](Emerald_Moon_base "wikilink"), where he is subsequently captured
by the Esmers.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") follows him using an [Esmer
shuttle](Esmer_shuttle "wikilink"). After Baldino is freed, both escape
from the Moon using the Spaceship again. They approach
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), in order to destroy the control centre
for the lunar reactors on [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink").

alt="The crash site on Otringal" /> However, the ship runs out of fuel,
so Twinsen and Baldino crash-land on [Otringal](Otringal "wikilink").
The ship gets severly damaged and needs a long time to get repaired.

With his technical skills and probably the help of the Twinsunian
wizards, Baldino finishes the repairs on his ship just in time when
Twinsen is facing [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink"). He manueveres the
ship into [Dark Monk's statue](Dark_Monk's_statue "wikilink") through a
hole on its back. When FunFrock releases the cage with the children
inside, attempting to throw it into the lava, it is caught by Baldino's
Spaceship hovering above the lava.

Twinsen and Baldino use the spaceship to emerge from Zeelich and head
back to Twinsun, which is still threatened by the Emerald Moon.
