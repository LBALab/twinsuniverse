The **Red Magnetic Card** is a magnetic card created by a
[forger](forger "wikilink") [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") living
on [Proxima Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink"), whose speciality is
faking such cards. Due to the phony red card traffic, this rabbibunny
was arrested, and his brother, who stays alone in their house, gives
such a card to whoever says the word "Amos" to him.

The card itself enables opening gates on numerous places around
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"), as well as operating the lift at the [ski
summit](ski_summit "wikilink") at the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink").

In [FunFrock's Headquarters](FunFrock's_Headquarters "wikilink") on
[Principal Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") meets the card forger, now imprisoned in
the fortress. The forger tells him about his brother, who will give him
a red card if Twinsen says the word "Amos" to him.

In the [forger's house](forger's_house "wikilink") on
[Proxim-City](Proxim-City "wikilink"), Twinsen receives a red magnetic
card from the [forger's brother](forger's_brother "wikilink").

The first place where Twinsen uses the card is the [Maritime
Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink"), which he enters through a side
door, since the place is heavily guarded. Twinsen later uses the card on
various places around the planet for opening many kinds of gates,
especially to enter [FunFrock's
headquarters](FunFrock's_headquarters "wikilink"), or even for operating
the lift at the ski summit.
