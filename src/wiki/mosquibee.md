**Mosquibee** is one of the four main species of the planet
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). Their name is derived from a combination
of *mosquito* and *bee*. With their wings, they are the only race in
Zeelich capable of flying.

The mosquibees usually keep to themselves, and outside the [Island of
the Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink") in the
[Under-Gas](Under-Gas "wikilink") of Zeelich, they are hardly seen
around the planet. A plaque in [Dark Monk's
temple](Dark_Monk's_temple "wikilink") describes them as such:

When the [Emperor](Emperor "wikilink") assisted
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink") in imposing as [Dark
Monk](Dark_Monk "wikilink"), the mosquibees are the only ones in the
planet who resist the Emperor's actions. Instead, they have their own
queen, [Astrid](Astrid "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") comes to the Island of the Mosquibees
knowing it provides access to [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"). Just
after he proves his trustworthiness to the queen, the Emperor's soldiers
attack the village, and a battle commences between them and the
mosquibees. Several mosquibees take hide then in [a
cave](mosquibees_hideout "wikilink") in [Volcano
Island](Volcano_Island "wikilink").
