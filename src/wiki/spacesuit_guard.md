The **spacesuit guards** can be found on [Emerald
Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink"), they each guard an airlock entrance.
When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") arrives on the Emerald Moon he needs
to give the guards an operation code. The guards are equipped with
double lasers (like the [Laser-Pistol of
Zarnon](Laser-Pistol_of_Zarnon "wikilink")), while Twinsen is equipped
with double lasers of a different kind.
