The **rebels** are inhabitants of [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") who
oppose [Dr. FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink") with military force. They
retreat to an [island](Rebellion_Island "wikilink") which is constantly
bombed by Funfrock's forces. They wage an ongoing war, tearing down the
teleportation pads, destroying all the [clones](clones "wikilink"), and
vanquishing the presence of FunFrock from its shores. New recruits train
in the [Rebel Camp](Rebel_Camp "wikilink"). The rebels primarily seem to
be [rabbibunnies](rabbibunnies "wikilink") and
[spheroes](spheroes "wikilink")

[Rebellion Island](Rebellion_Island "wikilink") is isolated, and the
rebels allow access to their
[harbour](Rebellion_Island_Harbour "wikilink") only to ships bearing a
[pirate flag](pirate_flag "wikilink").

The rebels never believe that the [northern
hemisphere](northern_hemisphere "wikilink") is uninhabitable as
FunFrock's propaganda says. They intended to traverse to it through the
fortified [Okojo Pass](Okojo_Pass "wikilink"), but during their attempt,
their colonel [Kroptman](Kroptman "wikilink") was captured.

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") arrives on the island by a
[Catamaran](Catamaran "wikilink"), the rebels already know him. A rebel
commander [Sphero](Sphero "wikilink") tells him about their fight, and
asks his help to free Kroptman.

Twinsen and the rebels take the landing boat from Rebellion Island, and
land on the shore of Okojo Pass, where Twinsen has to destroy the radio
with his [magic ball](magic_ball "wikilink"), to prevent communication
for an easier takeover. They then battle through the pass itself, until
they find a [tank](tank "wikilink") which they manage to seize for their
own use. The rest of the battle through the pass is afterwards an easy
task.

Once arriving at the fortress where Kroptman is captured, the rebels
stay behind to cover Twinsen while he ventures inside to free the
colonel. Once the colonel is freed he advises Twinsen to take the back
entrance out of the fortress.
