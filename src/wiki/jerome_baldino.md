**Jerome Baldino**, often referred to simply as **Baldino**, is a
[grobo](grobo "wikilink") working as an inventor. Among his inventions
are the [proto-pack](proto-pack "wikilink"),
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink")'s first prototype [space
ship](Baldino's_Spaceship "wikilink"), and a [portable
radio](portable_radio "wikilink") device. Jerome is
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s best friend, gives him advice, gadgets
and missions.

Baldino lives on [Proxima Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink") during
[FunFrock's Reign](FunFrock's_Reign "wikilink"), and on the [Island of
the White Leaf Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink")
during [Twinsen's Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink").

## During "FunFrock's Reign"

Twinsen first meets Baldino in [his
house](Jerome_Baldino's_residence_(Proxim-City) "wikilink") in
[Proxim-City](Proxim-City "wikilink"). Baldino is working on the
proto-pack at that time, and asks Twinsen to get him a [hair
dryer](hair_dryer "wikilink") in order to complete the work on it. After
Twinsen gets him a hair dryer, Baldino completes the proto-pack using
the hair dryer's rheostat, and offers Twinsen 10
[kashes](kashes "wikilink") in order to test it. Twinsen keeps the
proto-pack with him for the rest of the game.

## During "Twinsen's Odyssey"

During the time between [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s fall and the
beginning of Twinsen's second adventure, Twinsen and Baldino became
close friends. For unknown reasons, Baldino moved to the newly populated
Desert Island, where he continues his researches in [his
house](Jerome_Baldino's_residence_(Port-Ludo) "wikilink") in
[Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink"). There he has a giant telescope
pointed at the moon, and outside his house a huge weird shaped object
can be seen draped underneath some camouflage canvas, which later turns
out to be his space ship.

Due to Twinsen and Baldino being friends, Baldino sought to help Twinsen
whenever he could. When [Twinsen's car](Twinsen's_car "wikilink") breaks
down, Baldino gives Twinsen a [car part](car_part "wikilink") which is
needed to fix it, on [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink")'s request. Soon after that,
Baldino gives him a portable radio device, which enables him to
communicate with him and with Zoé.

Due to his inquisitive nature, Baldino uses his powerful telescope to
research the [Esmer](Esmer "wikilink") activities on [Emerald
Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink"). While Twinsen visits
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") for the first time, Baldino uses a space
ship he had secretly built to fly to Emerald Moon, to discover the
Esmers' demonic plan of destroying Twinsun. Because of his discovery,
the Esmers capture him and keep him in
[prison](Emerald_Moon_prison "wikilink"). Before leaving for Emerald
Moon, however, Baldino remembers to leave Twinsen the Proto-Pack, just
in case he might need it.

Using the radio, Baldino is able to tell Twinsen all about the Esmers'
plan, just before he is captured. He prompts Twinsen to steal a
[shuttle](Esmer_shuttle "wikilink") from the [Secret Esmer
base](Secret_Esmer_base "wikilink") on Desert Island, and use it to fly
to Emerald Moon. Twinsen obliges to his request, and soon busts Baldino
out of prison. After their escape, Twinsen and Baldino use Baldino's
ship to fly to [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") to destroy the control
center of the moon reactors on [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"). But as
Baldino's ship runs out of fuel, they crash on Zeelich.

Baldino spends most of the time on Zeelich on fixing the crashed space
ship. He asks Twinsen to retrieve some
[gazogem](Can_of_Gazogem "wikilink"), a powerful fuel produced on
Zeelich, which will enable him to repair and refuel the ship for their
voyage home. Despite Twinsen's reluctance, as he is already in a hurry
to find [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"), he agrees. After getting the
gazogem, Baldino is able to transform the rather weak Proto-Pack into
the much better [Super Jet-pack](Super_Jet-pack "wikilink"), which
allows Twinsen to fly higher and reach places he hasn't reached before,
such as the [Upper City](Upper_City "wikilink") of
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink").

During [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s final face off against Twinsen,
Baldino saves the children of Twinsun from falling into the lava under
[Dark Monk's Statue](Dark_Monk's_Statue "wikilink"), unbeknownst to
Twinsen and FunFrock, who think the children have fallen to their doom.
Baldino then takes Twinsen and the children back to Twinsun.
