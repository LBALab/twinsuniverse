The **blowtron** is a weapon firing projectiles. It is quite similar to
the [blowgun](blowgun "wikilink"), butis faster and causes more damage.
Its widest aperture, as well as it's thicker size, enable it to be
loaded with larger berries.

Searching for a way of reaching [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") reaches the [Mosquibees
Village](Mosquibees_Village "wikilink"), where he meets [Queen
Astrid](Queen_Astrid "wikilink"). To prove to the suspicious queen that
his intentions are good, he has to pass the [Test of
Truth](Test_of_Truth "wikilink"). Upon passing the challenge, Twinsen
receives the blowtron, a symbol for him being an equal of the
mosquibees.
