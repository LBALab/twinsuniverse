**Aristide** is a [grobo](grobo "wikilink") studying at the [School of
Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink"). He is either looking at the bulletin
board or sitting on the bench in the lobby. He is a rather bad pupil,
unable to complete any of the tests, as revealed by his complaining
about not even being able to pass the [Blowgun
Test](Blowgun_Test "wikilink"). He wonders whether or not he should even
continue trying to become a wizard.

Twinsen meets him several times at the school's entrance. He hasn't
shown any sign of posessing magical powers.
