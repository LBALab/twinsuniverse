**Supergros** are white [grobo](grobo "wikilink")
[clones](clones "wikilink"). They are armed with tablet launchers with
which they can put anyone they hit to sleep. These people can then be
brought to the nearest [prison](prison "wikilink"). They can be found in
every prison and would teleport out of a [telepod](telepod "wikilink")
when alarmed by a [nurse](nurse "wikilink"). Some can also be seen
guarding the upper areas of [Old Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink"), or
[FunFrock's Headquarters](FunFrock's_Headquarters "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") is not able to face the supergros for a
long time, and each time he meets one of them, he is instantly carried
to the nearest prison. However, after he gets the last level of magic
with the [flask of clear water](flask_of_clear_water "wikilink"), he is
able to fight them. Then, they no longer shoot sleeping tablets, but
deadly red projectiles, which can kill Twinsen in three hits.

Twinsen has to fight a supergro in the entrance of [FunFrock's
Headquarters](FunFrock's_Headquarters "wikilink"), to get the
[key](key "wikilink") to enter it.
