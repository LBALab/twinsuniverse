![A sphero](assets/lba2/_characters/bouboulanim.gif "A sphero")
**Sphero** is one of the four main species of Twinsun. This race of
small bio-androids has been living for years on
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") as an endangered species. Unfortunately,
they have been unable to breed for a very long time and have only a dim
hope of seeing tiny spheros cavorting around their gardens.
