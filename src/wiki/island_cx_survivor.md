The **Island CX Survivor** is the only person who ever went to [Island
CX](Island_CX "wikilink") and made it back alive. He's in pretty bad
shape since his return and is covered in bandages. He spends his time
now selling souveniers on [Celebration
Island](Celebration_Island "wikilink").

He tells [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") how dangerous Island CX is and
that he should go see [Rick](Rick "wikilink") if he wants to get there.
