**Lanktir** is a [grobo](grobo "wikilink") living in
[Proxim-City](Proxim-City "wikilink") at [Proxima
Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink"), next to the
[bazaar](Proxim-City_bazaar "wikilink").

Lanktir gives [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") a
[keypad](keypad "wikilink") which he received by accident. Twinsen can
use this keypad later to open a secret room in the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink"). Addtionally, if Twinsen
follows the directions in [LeBorgne](LeBorgne "wikilink")'s log, a
[sphero](sphero "wikilink") comes and gives him a [coffee
pot](coffee_pot "wikilink"), asking him to return it to Lanktir. In
return to the coffee pot, Lanktir gives Twinsen a [bonuses
list](bonuses_list "wikilink"), detailing the locations of some [clover
boxes](clover_boxes "wikilink") and clover leaves around
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink").
