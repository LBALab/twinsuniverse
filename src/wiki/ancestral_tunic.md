The **Ancestral Tunic**, as described in the [Book of
Bu](Book_of_Bu "wikilink"), was one of the four items required by the
Heir to be collected for him to ensure victory against the designated
tyrant. This magical tunic was kept for centuries upon centuries in a
secret closet at the house of the Heir's acnestors, and kept it safe for
the time when the Chosen One will be needing it.

This Ancestral Tunic is a great source of magic. Whoever wears it is
able to store an enormous amount of [magic
power](magic_power "wikilink"), which is vital for defeating his
enemies. The amount of magic available for storage depneds on the
owner's level of magic, and can range from Yellow to Fire.

Combined with the [Magic Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink"), which was also
kept in the secret closet at The Heir's house, these two magical items
make together an extremely powerful combination, which would almost
certainly ensure anyone success in his mission.

The tunic is coloured blue, probably to symbolize the close
relationships with the [Sendells](Sendell "wikilink") and [the
legend](the_legend "wikilink"), who are also blue.

Escaping from the [Citadel](Citadel "wikilink") at the beginning of the
game, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") makes it to [his and Zoe's
house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink"). Soon after Zoe is captured, and
Twinsen finds the closet at which the Ancestral Tunic, as well as the
magic ball, was kept. Putting it on, Twinsen immediately becomes
powerful, as he is now able to store magic, thus using his magic ball.
This tunic, which Twinsen keeps until the end of the game, proves very
powerful.

## During Twinsen's Odyssey

Some time between the plot of the two games, Twinsen contributed the
tunic to [Miss Bloop's Private
Museum](Miss_Bloop's_Private_Museum "wikilink"). He left a note in his
house to his future descendants:

However, having to free [Raph](Raph "wikilink") the
[lighthouse](lighthouse "wikilink") keeper, and, later on, the entire
planet, Twinsen quickly finds the tunic necessary again. Going to the
museum to reclaim the tunic, he finds out that the room at which the
button that opens the tunic's safe is locked. To get in, Twinsen has to
sneak in through the museum's window, and thus opening the tunic's safe.

Like in LBA 1, the tunic is Twinsen's primary object, along with the
magic ball. Apart from a short time, at which he walks around the
Twinsun and [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") with a [Wizard's Parade
Tunic](Wizard's_Parade_Tunic "wikilink"), Twinsen carries the Ancestral
Tunic with him until the end of the game.
