*This article is about [Quetch](Quetch "wikilink") nurses. For
[Grobo](Grobo "wikilink") nurses equipped with tablet launchers, see
[Supergro](Supergro "wikilink").*

</center>

**Nurses** are [quetches](quetch "wikilink") working in
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s factories and prisons. Their basic job
is to keep an eye on prisoners. However, they also do researches in the
[mutant factory](mutant_factory "wikilink") and the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink").

Nurses are always seen in the basic white nurse outfit. It is forbidden
to travel in the nurse outfit outside the prisons and factories,
although a [nurse](Teleportation_Center_guard "wikilink") is seen
outside in a white clothing guarding the entrance of the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink").

Nurses sometimes carry weapons like a truncheon or a gun.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") has to fight nurses at several places, as
in the [Citadel](Citadel "wikilink"), the [mutant
factory](mutant_factory "wikilink"), the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink") or [FunFrock's secret
fortress](FunFrock's_secret_fortress "wikilink"). Whenever a nurse
encounters Twinsen, it runs to the nearest alarm button calling a
[Supergro](Supergro "wikilink").

In order to escape from the [Citadel](Citadel "wikilink"), Twinsen has
to take on a nurse's clothing as a disguise.
