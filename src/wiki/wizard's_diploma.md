## Description

The **Wizard's Diploma** is the official proof that the owner is a fully
licensed wizard. This diplioma is given to anyone who graduates from the
[School of Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink") by the
[rector](Rector_of_the_School_of_Magic "wikilink").

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

In order to heal his [Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") had to become a fully licensed wizard. For
this, he had to pass three tests: the [Magic
Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink") test, the [Garden
Balsam](Garden_Balsam "wikilink") test, and the [Dome of the
Slate](Dome_of_the_Slate "wikilink") test.

Upon completion of all three tests, Twinsen became a wizard, and
received the desired diploma, making his magic level rise to Green Ball.
He was then able to buy a [wizard's parade
tunic](wizard's_parade_tunic "wikilink") from the wizard [Chedil
Amiradoo](Chedil_Amiradoo "wikilink"), which made him look like a
wizard. He was then able to go to [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), and
find out more details about the disappearance of the wizards.

When arriving on Zeelich for the second time, Twinsen found no more use
for the diploma, and, needing the money, sold it to the [Twinsunian
Souvenir Shop](Twinsunian_Souvenir_Shop "wikilink").
