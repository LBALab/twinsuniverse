'''Rick''' is a [[sup]] owning [[Rick's Café]] at the [[Otringal harbour|harbour]] of [[Otringal]]. He is also the head of the underworld in Otringal. He is almost impossible to be granted an audience with. Rick is considerably larger than any other sup met.

When searching for a way to access [[Island CX]], [[Twinsen]] talks with a [[franco]] on the [[Island of the Celebration]], the [[Island CX Survivor]], who tells him that the only ones who might be able to help him are Rick and his gang. Twinsen then goes to Rick's Café, where he finds out that Rick's office is well guarded by heavily sized [[wannie]]s. Twinsen has two ways to enter Rick's office: either by killing his body guards until one of them leaves behind the [[key]] to the office, or by going through the backstage of the café and through a ventilation shaft.

In his office, Twinsen tells Rick about [[Twinsun]] being endangerd by the plans of the [[Emperor]]. Rick reveals that he is unable to help Twinsen, and sends him to talk with [[Johnny Rocket]] at the [[Imperial Hotel]], who is the head of the rebelling [[dissidents]].
