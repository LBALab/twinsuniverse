The '''Red Magnetic Card''' is a magnetic card created by a [[forger]] [[rabbibunny]] living on [[Proxima Island]], whose speciality is faking such cards. Due to the phony red card traffic, this rabbibunny was arrested, and his brother, who stays alone in their house, gives such a card to whoever says the word "Amos" to him.

The card itself enables opening gates on numerous places around [[Twinsun]], as well as operating the lift at the [[ski summit]] at the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

In [[FunFrock's Headquarters]] on [[Principal Island]], [[Twinsen]] meets the card forger, now imprisoned in the fortress. The forger tells him about his brother, who will give him a red card if Twinsen says the word "Amos" to him.

In the [[forger's house]] on [[Proxim-City]], Twinsen receives a red magnetic card from the [[forger's brother]].

The first place where Twinsen uses the card is the [[Maritime Museum]], which he enters through a side door, since the place is heavily guarded. Twinsen later uses the card on various places around the planet for opening many kinds of gates, especially to enter [[FunFrock's headquarters]], or even for operating the lift at the ski summit.
