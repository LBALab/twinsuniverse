== Description ==
'''The Zeelich Gazette''' is a newspaper published on [[Zeelich]]. Unlike other newspapers like [[The Inquirer]], it is not a serious newspaper. Most likely it is a paper of the yellow press, as it was not focussing on [[Twinsen]] like the other newspapers did after [[Twinsen]] was recognized by a [[Franco guard]] on the [[Island of the Celebration]], but rather tells about the life of [[Johnny Rocket]].
