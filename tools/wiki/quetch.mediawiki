'''Quetch''' is one of the four main species of the planet [[Twinsun]]. Their shape resembles humand, and they are characterized by a pony tail haircut.

Quetches are scattered on various islands around the planet, and are not concentrated in one place.

It is among the quetches that [[Sendell]] implanted a line of chosen ones, capable of rising up if required to defend the planet. [[Twinsen]], the hero of the [[Little Big Adventure]] series, is a quetch who discovers that he is the chosen one destined to defeat the tyrant [[Dr. FunFrock]].
