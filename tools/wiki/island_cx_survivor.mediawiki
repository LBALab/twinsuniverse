The '''Island CX Survivor''' is the only person who ever went to [[Island CX]] and made it back alive. He's in pretty bad shape since his return and is covered in bandages. He spends his time now selling souveniers on [[Celebration Island]].

He tells [[Twinsen]] how dangerous Island CX is and that he should go see [[Rick]] if he wants to get there.
