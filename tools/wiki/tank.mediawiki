'''Tanks''' are heavy battle tanks in the army of [[FunFrock]].

The tanks are used mainly for defending actions and attacking actions as well. There can be found one in the middle of [[Lupin-Burg]], enforcing surveillance. It was also used to destroy [[Twinsen's house]]. There are also tanks guarding FunFrock's fortresses, or the [[Okojo Pass]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. They could also be seen on [[Desert Island]].

During the rebel assault on the [[Okojo Pass]], [[Twinsen]] and a rebel rabbibunny steal a tank in order to get access to the small fort guarding the pass. However, the tank is not controlled by Twinsen, but by the rebel rabbibunny instead.

Twinsen also has to destroy a tank guarding [[FunFrock's secret fortress]], in order to get access to it.
