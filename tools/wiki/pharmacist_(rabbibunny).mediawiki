The '''pharmacist''' is a female [[rabbibunny]] running the [[pharmacy]] in [[Lupin-Bourg East]] on [[Citadel Island]], during [[Twinsen's Odyssey]]. She is the sister of [[Raph]], the [[lighthouse]] keeper.

After [[Dino-Fly]] is hit by a lightning during the [[storm]], [[Zo√©]] sends [[Twinsen]] to the pharmacy to find a cure for him. The pharmacist tells Twinsen that she doesn't have anything for a Dino-Fly.

After the storm, in case Twinsen hadn't talked with [[Leone]] earlier, the pharmacist tells him that the healing wizard [[Ker'aooc]] might be able to help him.

The [[quetch guy]] behind the [[Weather Wizard's Tent]] has a big crush on the Pharmacist.
