The '''Franco Laser Soldier''' is encountered at numerous places, and answers to the [[:category:Imperial Legion|Imperial Legion]] on [[Zeelich]]. They carry a red laser gun, and often guard junctions, entrances and exits, or patroll populated areas.

When he reaches Magic Level Fire, [[Twinsen]] can defeat them more easily, though they are still a threat by their number. For instance, the small streets of the [[Island of the Wannies]] are guarded by at least eight laser soldiers.
