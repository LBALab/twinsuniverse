'''Mr. Lemoine''' is a [[wannie]] working as a priest in [[Dark Monk's chapel]] at the [[Village of the Wannies]]. He is very dedicated to the case of [[Dark Monk's prophecy]], and attempts to warn anyone to not interfere with their religious ceremonies.

[[Twinsen]] goes to the chapel in a search for a way to reach the [[Island of the Mosquibees]]. After Mr. Lemoine warns him not to interfere with [[Dark Monk's ceremony]], he tells Twinsen that he should consult his housemaid [[Annie]], who knows how to reach the mosquibees.
