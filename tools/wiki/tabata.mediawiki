==Description==
Tabata is a [[quetch]], and the only female Wizard of [[Twinsun]]. She's extremely friendly and flirtatious, especially with [[Twinsen]]. She is one of the wizards kidnapped by the [[esmer]]s.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
After the wizards were freed, she was the one speaking to [[Twinsen]], and seemed to lead the group of wizards eventhough the [[Rector of the School of Magic]] was with them. She also sat in one of the shuttles which destroyed the lunar reactor.
