'''Fire-Flies''' live close to lava and in warm caves. Like the [[bat]]s, [[Twinsen]] will get hurt if he runs into a fire-fly, but they often give Twinsen a [[clover leaf]] or much life-/magicpoints if he manages to kill one. Fire-flies are also the main ingredient of the Wannie's very tasty [[Slice of Tart]].

On their own fire-flies won't attack, but will hit Twinsen once when he walks in their path. He can be hit by 1 or 2 lifepoints.
