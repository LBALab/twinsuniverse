The '''Captain''' is a nameless [[Franco]] who transports people around the islands of [[Zeelich's Surface]] for the price of 10 [[Zlitos]]. He calls his boat "Leontine".

When [[Twinsen]] crashes on [[Otringal]], his main objective is to find a way to reach [[Island CX]]. At the [[Otringal harbour|harbour]] he finds the captain, and as all other ferries refuse to take Twinsen to Island CX, the Captain thinks he can help him, for an unusual fee of 100 Zlitos. He's the only one who is able to help Twinsen, so Twinsen doesn't have much choice. Twinsen pays him the 100 Zlitos, and the captain tells Twinsen about [[Island CX Survivor|a franco]] on [[Celebration Island]] who went to the island and came back alive. He then takes Twinsen to the island for free.

When coming back from Celebration Island, Twinsen discovers why he was attacked by the guards, and why the captain charged such a high fee, as [[Dark Monk]] has put Twinsen on the wanted list.

It's possible to use the captain's services afterwards, although he charges twice as much for journeys as the other captains in the harbour.
