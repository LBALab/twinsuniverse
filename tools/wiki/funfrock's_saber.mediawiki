'''FunFrock's Saber''' is a saber (often also known as the '''Magic Saber''') that once belonged to [[Dr. FunFrock]], although he does not actually use it in the game. This saber is considered the most powerful weapon on [[Twinsun]], and is capable of killing most creatures.

In [[Little Big Adventure 1]], the saber is locked in a safe in [[FunFrock's headquarters]] at [[Principal Island]]. This safe is guarded by a few [[clones]], including a clone of FunFrock himself.

[[Twinsen]] finds the sword in the safe when he comes to the hadquarters to search for the plans of the [[Teleportation Center]]. 

The way Twinsen uses the saber may varies, depending on his behaviour:
* '''Normal''': Twinsen hits the enemy by walking forward and cutting.
* '''Sporty''': Twinsen jumps back once and then forward to hit the enemy.
* '''Agressive''': Twinsen acts extremer than in Normal mode, and also jumps and turns a couple of times at the enemy.
* '''Discreet''': Twinsen uses the sword as silent as possible. He also acts the least aggresive.

Using the sword, Twinsen is able to defeat some enemies he couldn't beforehand, such as [[red clones]]. In the final battle against FunFrock in the [[Well of Sendell]], it's possible to kill him only with the sword.
