 |Haha! You too are looking for his treasure? Well I sure once had a dusty book about LeBorgne, but a customer bought it this morning. It was a rabbibunny. I know that he works over at the library.

 |I don't know her. But go and see Wadbull over at the bazaar. And be careful... normally it is forbidden to talk about that.
