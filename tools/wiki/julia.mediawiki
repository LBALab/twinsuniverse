'''Julia''' is a female [[rabbibunny]] living in a [[Julia's house|house]] in the [[Old Burg]] on [[Principal Island]]. She owns a big screen television, one of the only few televisions found on [[Twinsun]]. Julia is best friend to [[Beatrice]], and according to her she watches television too much.

When [[Twinsen]] first arrives to the Old Burg, he finds out that the local citizens are afraid of him. Julia advices him that in order to win the people's trust, he should "clobber a [[clone]]". After Twinsen does so, Julia, as well as the rest of the town's citizens, is willing to talk to him. Julia tells Twinsen a long story, which hints him about a [[clover box]] located on an islet off [[Peg Leg Street]]. She tells him to go to Beatrice and ask her about it.
