A '''Schmoutz''' is a yellow creature which looks like a fusion of a puppy dog and a pig. These creatures are kept as pets by [[Zeelich]]ians.

The [[Wannie]] family who eat Fire-Fly tarts have one. There is also one wandering the [[Wannie Mines]]. The old [[Sup]] woman at the [[Imperial Hotel]] can be found playing with hers as well.
