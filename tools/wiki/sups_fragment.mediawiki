==Description==
The '''Sups Fragment''' was one of the four fragments which together summoned [[Dark Monk's Statue]] to complete the ceremony. This turned back [[Zeelich]] to its original look after 10,000 ceremonies. The Sups Fragment is the blue "under" piece of [[Dark Monk's Key]].

The fragment was located in the back room of the [[Emperor's Palace]], heavily guarded by [[Hussars]] and an unidentified monster.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
As a part of his quest of uniting the four key fragments, [[Twinsen]] had to find the Sups Fragment. However, he wasn't able to reach it, as it was located in the heavily-guarded Emperor's Palace. After killing the [[emperor]], Twinsen took his [[Emperor's Sword|sword]], with which he was able to fight his way to the fragment. Once defeating 3 guards in the back room of the palace, Twinsen had only to defeat a two-headed monster in order to get the key to the fragment. Twinsen took the fragment, and had to fight his way back outside in order to complete [[Dark Monk's prophecy|the prophecy]].
