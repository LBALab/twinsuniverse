'''Franco Pike Guards''' are omnipresent guards of the [[Emperor]]'s [[:category:Imperial Legion|army]] on [[Zeelich]]. They wield a long pike. They are seen at any place needing minor guarding, like the [[astroport]], the [[gazogem refinery]], and on many streets throughout the entire planet. Together with [[Franco Technician]]s they build the crew of the [[Emerald Moon base]].

Along with the [[Esmer invasion]] on [[Twinsun]] they can be seen in the streets of [[Lupin-Bourg]], [[Port-Ludo]] and the [[secret esmer base]].<sup>[move to [[Franco Skater Green|skaters]] article]</sup>

They are guarding the little harbour at the [[Island of the Celebration]], and are stationed next to [[Otringal Prison]].

When setting off an alarm in an airlock of the [[Emerald Moon base]], Twinsen is able to lure a guard into it. He quickly takes on his space suit and opens the outer doors. Thus the franco guard, not wearing a space suit, is sucked out of the room into space.
