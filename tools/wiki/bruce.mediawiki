'''Bruce''' is a [[sphero]] residing in a tent near the shore in an uninhabited area of the [[White Leaf Desert]]. Bruce gives [[Twinsen]] a small hint about treasures buried in the [[Temple of BÃ¹]].

Bruce disappears from his usual location after the invasion of the [[esmer]]s, and is not seen again in the game.
