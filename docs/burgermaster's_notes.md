**The Burgermaster's Notes** are notes providing instructions as to
where the [Francos Fragment](Francos_Fragment "wikilink") is found. They
were written by [Roger de la Fontaine](Roger_de_la_Fontaine "wikilink"),
the keeper of the fragment, who was eaten by a [gas
monster](gas_monster "wikilink").

The notes were written in a cryptic way:

The natural parasol mentioned is the big green palm tree in the island.
The person following the notes should stand with his back facing the
tree, looking at the middle of the
[bazaar](Francos_Island_bazaar "wikilink"). The person should be in the
sporty mode, to get the correct number of steps, measured by the number
of lamp-posts and arches in the island. The treasure hunter should not
follow the fences to the left, but instead go right near the gas and dig
there to retrieve the buried key fragment.

In a search for the Francosk key fragment, Twinsen arrived to the
[Island of the Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"), where he met
[Roger de la Fontaine's
brother](Roger_de_la_Fontaine's_brother "wikilink"), who told him that
Roger left instructions needed for finding the fragment. After finding
the key to the cupboard where the instructions are locked, Twinsen took
the notes and used the clues in them to find the fragment.
