The **magic ball** is a ball that stores a great deal of magic. This
ball bounces a couple of times if it doesn't hit any enemy, and then
automatically returns to its owner. The magic ball needs the [Ancestral
Tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink") to function, since it is the primary
source of magic. This weapon upgrades along with its owner's magic
level.

The color of the magic ball indicates the possessor's current level of
magic. The magic levels are, from weakest to strongest: yellow, green,
red and fire. To increase the magic level, one needs to recover magical
items, one for each level.

Every time Twinsen throws his magic ball, it uses some [magic
points](Flask_of_Magic_Powder "wikilink"). If the person is out of magic
points, the ball can still be thrown, but it won't bounce any more,
which dramatically decreases the ball range and functionality.

The magic ball can be used for some special functions. Firstly, the
trajectory of the ball can be altered by changing the [behaviour
mode](behaviour_mode "wikilink"). In discreet mode, for example, the
ball is thrown higher instead of far. This is handy for reaching
switches or enemies that can't be reached otherwise. Second, the magic
ball can retrieve [keys](key "wikilink"); if there is a key somewhere in
the current scene, throwing the magic ball at it will pick it up and
return it to the owner.

The magic ball is [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s primary ranged weapon
in his two adventures. Due to its great functionality and powerful
shots, this weapon is most used by Twinsen in both his adventures, not
only as a weapon, but also to reach switches and retrieve keys.

The four items Twinsen has to obtain in the two games in order to get a
higher level of magic are:

**[Little Big Adventure 1](Little_Big_Adventure_1 "wikilink")**:

- [Ancestral Tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink")
- [Book of Bù](Book_of_Bù "wikilink")
- [Sendell's Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink")
- [Flask of Clear Water](Flask_of_Clear_Water "wikilink")

**[Little Big Adventure 2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink")**:

- [Ancestral Tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink") + [Sendell's
  Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink") (these are now one and the
  same)
- [Wizard's Diploma](Wizard's_Diploma "wikilink")
- [Sendell's Ball](Sendell's_Ball "wikilink")
- [Dark Monk's Key](Dark_Monk's_Key "wikilink")
