## Description

**The Tralü** is a monster who lives in the [caves](caves "wikilink") up
in the [cliffs](cliffs "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), and who no one was sure actually
existed, until it was killed by [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") when he
was freeing [Raph](Raph "wikilink") the
[Lighthouse](Lighthouse "wikilink") keeper.

The Tralü has two mini-Tralüs, possibly offspring, who Twinsen
encounters in the caves first. Unlike the smaller ones, the bigger Tralü
has two attacks, one being the green darts that it shoots from it's
mouth and the second being it's spin attack. The two smaller ones only
have the dart attack.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

When Twinsen discovers Raph captured by the Tralü, about to be turned
into his dinner, Twinsen goes through several parts of the cave to reach
and kill the Tralü, and free Raph, so the [Weather
Wizard](Weather_Wizard "wikilink") can use his
[Lighthouse](Lighthouse "wikilink") for a
[spell](Ring_of_Lightning "wikilink").
