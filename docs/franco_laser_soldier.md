The **Franco Laser Soldier** is encountered at numerous places, and
answers to the [Imperial Legion](:category:Imperial_Legion "wikilink")
on [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). They carry a red laser gun, and often
guard junctions, entrances and exits, or patroll populated areas.

When he reaches Magic Level Fire, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") can
defeat them more easily, though they are still a threat by their number.
For instance, the small streets of the [Island of the
Wannies](Island_of_the_Wannies "wikilink") are guarded by at least eight
laser soldiers.
