**Nitro-Meca-Penguin** is a weapon available in [Little Big Adventure
2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"). Those penguins are similar to the
[Meca-Penguins](Meca-Penguins "wikilink") used in [Little Big Adventure
1](Little_Big_Adventure_1 "wikilink"), although slightly different. Once
such a penguin is launched, it moves a few inches forward, and explodes
5 seconds after, creating some damage around its explosion point.

Nitro-Meca-Penguins can be found in some shops, as well as in hidden
places around [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") and
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). One room in [Dark Monk's
Temple](Dark_Monk's_Temple "wikilink") is full of these penguins. It is
possible to possess a maximum of 10 penguins at a time.
