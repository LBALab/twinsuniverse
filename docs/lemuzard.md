**Lemuzard** is a creature used in a betting-game at the
[Casino](Casino "wikilink") in [Otringal](Otringal "wikilink").

In this game, the betting person can place his bet of 1
[zlito](zlito "wikilink") on any of the four holes at an arena. If the
Lemuzard enters this hole, the person receives 10
[zlitos](zlitos "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") can use the [Horn of the Blue
Triton](Horn_of_the_Blue_Triton "wikilink") to cheat in this game; if
the Lemuzard touches the [life candy](life_candy "wikilink") thrown from
it, he is more likely to enter the hole Twinsen bets on.
