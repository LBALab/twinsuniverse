## Description

**Sendell** is thought to be the goddess of
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"), but actually there is a race of Sendells
that lives in the core of Twinsun. She and other Sendells are watching
over a [Stellar Entity](Stellar_Entity "wikilink") that is in gestation
in the center of Twinsun.

They have been contacting [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s ancestors to
preserve the [Legend](Legend_of_Sendell "wikilink") that in the future
will save the planet from [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s
dictatorship.

In [LBA](Little_Big_Adventure "wikilink"), she calls
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") for help in his dreams, warning him of
[FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink")'s dictatorship. She too gives
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") magical powers (see [Legend of
Sendell](Legend_of_Sendell "wikilink")). She finally tells Twinsen that
Stellar Entity is watched by her and other Sendells.

In [LBA2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"), she helps Twinsen defeat
FunFrock and save Twinsun again.

## Trivia
