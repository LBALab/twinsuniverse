## Description

This humanoid race has a huge triangular head and a thin body. The Sups
live mainly on the island of [Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"). They are
the intellectual elite of the planet [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") where
they dominate the other races, imposing their iron rule on all and
sundry in the name of [their Emperor](Emperor_of_Zeelich "wikilink").
Their advanced technology allows them to travel from galaxy to galaxy
and attempt to populate other planets. The Emperor and [Dark
Monk](Dark_Monk "wikilink") appear to maintain excellent relations...
