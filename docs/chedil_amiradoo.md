**Chedil Amiradoo** is a [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") peddler on
[Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink") who makes living from selling
various magic accessories to fully licensed wizards. Throughout
[Twinsen's Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink"), he circles around the
[White Leaf Desert](White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink") on his magical flying
carpet. People who wish to buy goods from him are required to show him
their [Wizard's Diploma](Wizard's_Diploma "wikilink"), as a proof of
them being fully licensed.

Upon qualifying from the [School of Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") is advised by the [rector of the
school](Rector_of_the_School_of_Magic "wikilink") to go meet Chedil
Amiradoo, and buy a [Wizard's Parade
Tunic](Wizard's_Parade_Tunic "wikilink") from him. Once bumping into him
in the desert, Twinsen shows him his newly given wizard's diploma, as a
proof of his wizardry. In return to 50 [kashes](kashes "wikilink")
Twinsen receives a parade tunic and a fake wizard beard.

Twinsen can also buy [Orange Powder](Orange_Powder "wikilink") from
Chedil, and he also gives Twinsen a hint as to where the wizards are
going with the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink").

When Twinsen comes back from [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") for the first
time, Chedil is no longer seen around the island.
