**Roger de la Fontaine** was the Burgmaster of the [Island of the
Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"), who was in charge of looking
after the [Francos Key Fragment](Francos_Key_Fragment "wikilink"). He
often buried the fragment to keep it safe, so that nobody could find it
and steal it. One of his favourite pastimes was to spend time near the
Gas, and that is where he met his death - eaten by a [gas
monster](gas_monster "wikilink"). Because nobody knew where he hid the
fragment, the entire Island was whipped up into a frenzy, and everybody
started looking for the fragment.

When searching for the lost fragment himself,
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") finds the [burgermaster's
key](burgermaster's_key "wikilink"), with which he opens a cupboard in
[Roger de la Fontaine's house](Roger_de_la_Fontaine's_house "wikilink").
In this cupboard he finds the [burgermaster's
notes](burgermaster's_notes "wikilink"), which provide clues about
finding the fragment.

Roger de la Fontaine means "Roger of the Fountain" in French.
