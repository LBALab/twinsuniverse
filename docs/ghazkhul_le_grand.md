**Ghazkhul le Grand** is an Orc, a
[Mercenary](Category%3AMercenaries "wikilink"), assumably also an
Assassin (like the [Money-Monkey](Money-Monkey "wikilink")) sent by Dark
Monk (really [Dr. FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink")) to kill
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") before he could get to [Island
CX](Island_CX "wikilink").

The Orc is a monster larger than [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink"). He
carries a huge sword and can hit him very hard with multiple attacks
(... lifepoints). He also has a considerable amount of lifepoints and
that's why he is hard to kill.

He guards the [Queen of the Mosquibees'](Astrid "wikilink") throne.
However, Twinsen is strong enough to be able to beat him.

The name "Ghazkul le Grand" is not mentioned in the actual game, only in
the Little Big Adventure 2 website
[1](http://www.littlebigadventure2.com/lba2/FAMILLE/OTHERSZ.HTM).
