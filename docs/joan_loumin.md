**Joan Loumin** is a [mosquibee](mosquibee "wikilink") acting as part of
the [dissidents](dissident "wikilink") group on
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). He has been chosen by the Mosquibee
Rebellions to speak in the Dissident's Group for the Mosquibees. He will
be able to help Twinsen to continue his adventure.

His name is not mentioned in the actual game, and is only written in the
official [Little Big Adventure 2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink")
website
[1](http://www.littlebigadventure2.com/lba2/FAMILLE/MOSQUIEN.HTM).
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") meets him in several different places
during the game.

Twinsen first meets Joan during his first trip to
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), while escaping from the
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink") [prison](Otringal_prison "wikilink").
Joan is held as a prisoner in another cell, and Twinsen can release him
by hitting the switch on the top floor. While this is not a neccessarry
part of the game, a player who does release Joan gets an advice from him
about leaving through the back door, as the front entrance is heavily
guarded. Understanding Joan at this point requires owning a
[translator](translator "wikilink"), and a player who did not pick one
earlier in the game hears Zeelichian from him instead.

Twinsen later meets Joan and his dissident fellows at the [Twinsunian
Souvenir Shop](Twinsunian_Souvenir_Shop "wikilink") in Otringal. While
Twinsen informs the Dissident's about the lunar reactor, they help him
prepare for his trip to [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"), and hand him
a [Laser-Pistol](Laser-Pistol "wikilink").

When arriving to the [Island of the
Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink"), Twinsen sees Joan
standing next to the queen [Astrid](Astrid "wikilink"). When Astrid asks
Twinsen for a proof of his good intentions, Joan hints him that it is
the [Dissident's Ring](Dissident's_Ring "wikilink") she's looking for.

Joan later witnesses Twinsen undergoing the Test of Truth at the
[Challenge room](Challenge_room "wikilink"). Just after Twinsen
completes the challenge, the emperor's soldiers attack the village, and
Joan, together with the queen and another mosquibee, is captured. They
are being held prisoners at the [Building
Company](Building_Company "wikilink") in [Wannies
Island](Wannies_Island "wikilink").

Twinsen goes to their cell in the Building Company, in order to get the
[Key to the Passage to CX](Key_to_the_Passage_to_CX "wikilink") from the
queen. Joan advices him to get there as soon as possible.

Joan is lastly seen at the end of the game, in the party on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").

## Character origins

The model for Joan Loumin is the active member of French Resistance
during the World War II [Jean Moulin](Wikipedia:Jean_Moulin "wikilink"),
who was one of the most active French Resistance members during the
World War II, close to the commanders and captured by the enemy more
than once. To add to the similarity, Jean Moulin's image is associated
with a scarf he often wore to hide scarring and the typical for the time
period fedora hat.
