**Luc** is a [grobo](grobo "wikilink") and owner of the pub [Chez
Luc](Chez_Luc "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").

He works behind the counter and tells [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") that
he can purchase Life and Magic Points from the bar. Twinsen doesn't have
to talk with Luc, thus he has no vital role.
