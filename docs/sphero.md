![A sphero](BouboulAnim.gif "A sphero") **Sphero** is one of the four
main species of Twinsun. This race of small bio-androids has been living
for years on [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") as an endangered species.
Unfortunately, they have been unable to breed for a very long time and
have only a dim hope of seeing tiny spheros cavorting around their
gardens.
