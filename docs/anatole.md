**Anatole** is an old [sphero](sphero "wikilink"). He often has pain in
his back, which is treated by the healing wizard
[Ker'aooc](Ker'aooc "wikilink"). In his spare time, he likes to play
pétanque with his [friend Carlo](Carlo_(Port-Ludo) "wikilink") at the
pétanque pitch in [Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink") in [Desert
Island](Desert_Island "wikilink"). Anatole keeps losing the game due to
his hurt back.

Anatole gives [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") some hints, for example
about the [School of Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink") or the wizards.
Using the [Horn of the Blue Triton](Horn_of_the_Blue_Triton "wikilink"),
Twinsen is able to heal Anatole, thus letting him win all his bowling
games against Carlo, which upsets Carlo.
