[Leone](Leone "wikilink"), the cleaner of the Healing Wizard,
[Ker'aooc](Ker'aooc "wikilink").

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Looking for a way to treat his [Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") went to the
[pharmacy](pharmacy "wikilink"), where he witnessed the stealing of this
umbrella. Leone, the rightful owner of the umbrella, was willing to help
Twinsen find a cure for Dino-Fly, if the [quetch](quetch "wikilink")
would bring her the umbrella back. To retrieve the umbrella, Twinsen had
to sneak to the rabbibunny thief, thus being able to scare him and get
the umbrella from him. Once returning the umbrella to Leone, the sphero

[Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink").
