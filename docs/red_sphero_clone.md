**Red Sphero Clones** are [sphero](sphero "wikilink")
[clones](clone "wikilink") created by [Dr.
FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink"). They are used as guards for his
[secret fortress](FunFrock's_Secret_Fortress "wikilink") and are also
used on the secret [construction site](construction_site "wikilink")
between [Fortress](Fortress_Island "wikilink") and [Polar
Island](Polar_Island "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") has to defeat a Red Sphero Clone guarding
the entrance to the secret fortress in order to access it. He needs the
clone's [key](key "wikilink") to open the locked door.

On the Construction site, Twinsen runs into them on several occasions,
but he never has to defeat one of them there. One Red Sphero Clone on
the construction site is, however, holding a [Clover
leaf](Clover_leaf "wikilink").
