**LeBorgne** was a pirate who roamed the entire [southern
hemisphere](southern_hemisphere "wikilink") several hundred years before
[FunFrock's Reign](FunFrock's_Reign "wikilink"), and is now a famous
historical character among the [Twinsunians](Twinsun "wikilink"). It is
common knowledge that LeBorgne was almost illiterate and had the
captain's log written for him by his cook. It is also he who had killed
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s ancestor
[Hégésippe](Hégésippe "wikilink"). LeBorgne's treasure, of which the
location was for long unknown, is an exhibit in the [Maritime
Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink") on [Proxima
Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink").

## Name origin

"LeBorgne" is not his real name, which remains unknown. The nickname
LeBorgne that everyone knows him by is translated as "The One-eyed",
which is explained by the following entry from the book about LeBorgne
at the [Principal Island](Principal_Island "wikilink")
[library](library "wikilink").

## In the game

When Twinsen finds out that he is the current Heir, he has to retrieve
the items and information left for him by his ancestors in the room
underneath [his house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). The [key](Ancestral_Key "wikilink")
to this room, however, had been lost a few generations before. The last
family member to have possession of this key was
[Hégésippe](Hégésippe "wikilink"). He was killed by LeBorgne, and the
key was stolen and kept with his other treasures. Twinsen has to find
LeBorgne's treasure to gain entry to the secret room.

Futhermore, in order to approach the [Rebellion
Island](Rebellion_Island "wikilink"), Twinsen has to display on [his
ship](catamaran "wikilink") an emblem for the opposition: a [pirate
flag](pirate_flag "wikilink"). To this end, Twinsen ended up procuring
the pirate flag of the legendary LeBorgne.

After asking many people around the planet, Twinsen reaches the library
in Principal Island, where he hears from a grobo that the treasure is
stored in the Maritime Museum. Twinsen sneaks in there, and steals the
Ancestral Key, as well as the pirate flag.
