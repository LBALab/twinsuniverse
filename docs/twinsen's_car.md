## Description

**Twinsen's car** is a yellow buggy owned by
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink"). It has a cannon under its hood, which has
the power of Twinsen's [Magic Level](Magic_Ball "wikilink"). When
driving over a ramp, it can jump high and far.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Twinsen needed the car to get the [Garden Balsam
Flower](Garden_Balsam_Flower "wikilink"). It was on a tall mountain in
the [White Leaf Desert](White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"), which could only
be reached by jumping over a gap from a nearby mountain using the car.

However, the car first needed repairs. Twinsen fetched a [car
part](car_part "wikilink") from [Jerome
Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink"), and his wife [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink")
fixed the car with it for him. She then brought it to [Desert
Island](Desert_Island "wikilink") with the [ferry](ferry "wikilink").

With the car, Twinsen was able to get the Garden Balsam Flower and thus
finish the second test of the [School of
Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink"). Twinsen later used the car for races
at [von Kournil Tour](von_Kournil_Tour "wikilink") and travelling long
distances on Desert Island. He also used the car's powerful gun to
defeat Esmer robots during the [Esmer](Esmer "wikilink") invasion.

## Trivia

Eventually, Twinsen lost his car on the mountain of the Garden Balsam
Flower. He was no longer able to get up to the mountain to get his car.
However, the racer at von Kournil Tour found it and sold it Twinsen back
for 50 [Kashes](Kash "wikilink").
