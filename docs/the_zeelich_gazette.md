## Description

**The Zeelich Gazette** is a newspaper published on
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). Unlike other newspapers like [The
Inquirer](The_Inquirer "wikilink"), it is not a serious newspaper. Most
likely it is a paper of the yellow press, as it was not focussing on
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") like the other newspapers did after
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") was recognized by a [Franco
guard](Franco_guard "wikilink") on the [Island of the
Celebration](Island_of_the_Celebration "wikilink"), but rather tells
about the life of [Johnny Rocket](Johnny_Rocket "wikilink").
