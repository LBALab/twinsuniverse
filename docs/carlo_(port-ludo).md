**Carlo** is a [Quetch](Quetch "wikilink") pétanque player together with
his friend [Anatole](Anatole "wikilink"), in the pétanque pitch in
[Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink").

He does not help [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") with anything. If Twinsen
walks in the middle of the pitch, he continuously shouts "cheater!".
