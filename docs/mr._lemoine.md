**Mr. Lemoine** is a [wannie](wannie "wikilink") working as a priest in
[Dark Monk's chapel](Dark_Monk's_chapel "wikilink") at the [Village of
the Wannies](Village_of_the_Wannies "wikilink"). He is very dedicated to
the case of [Dark Monk's prophecy](Dark_Monk's_prophecy "wikilink"), and
attempts to warn anyone to not interfere with their religious
ceremonies.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") goes to the chapel in a search for a way
to reach the [Island of the
Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink"). After Mr. Lemoine
warns him not to interfere with [Dark Monk's
ceremony](Dark_Monk's_ceremony "wikilink"), he tells Twinsen that he
should consult his housemaid [Annie](Annie "wikilink"), who knows how to
reach the mosquibees.
