The **Francos Fragment** is one of the four fragments which together
summon [Dark Monk's statue](Dark_Monk's_statue "wikilink") to complete
[his ceremony](Dark_Monk's_prophecy "wikilink"). This should turn
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink") back in its original look after 10,000
ceremonies. The Francos Fragment is the red right piece of [Dark Monk's
key](Dark_Monk's_key "wikilink").

The fragment itself was lost years before the events of [Little Big
Adventure 2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"), as the franco who hid
it, [Roger de la Fontaine](Roger_de_la_Fontaine "wikilink"), was eaten
by a [gas monster](gas_monster "wikilink"). Due to that, most of the
inhabitants of the [Island of the
Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink") are searching for it.

As part of his quest to unite the four key fragments into Dark Monk's
key, Twinsen has to find the Francos Fragment. Using the tips he hears
from the people of the island, Twinsen manages to find the [Franco
Burgermaster's Key](Franco_Burgermaster's_Key "wikilink"), which he uses
to get the [Franco Burgermaster's
Notes](Franco_Burgermaster's_Notes "wikilink"). Following the
instructions on the notes, Twinsen reaches a place behind the [local
bazaar](Francos_Island_bazaar "wikilink"). Once digging there by using a
[pick-ax](pick-ax "wikilink") he buys from the bazaar, the fragment is
in his possession.
