*This article is about the grobo. For the astronomer sphero, see [Bob
Vortix](Bob_Vortix "wikilink").*

</center>

**Bob** is a [grobo](grobo "wikilink") living on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). Throughout most of [Twinsen's
Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink") he is seen patrolling the western
part of [Lupin-Burg](Lupin-Burg "wikilink"), for no apparent reason. He
is quite grumpy and complains a lot. Bob has a little grobo brother,
studying at the [schoolhouse](schoolhouse "wikilink") of Citadel Island.

While it's raining, Bob complains to [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") about
the weather and how he doesn't understand why the [Weather
Wizard](Weather_Wizard "wikilink") isn't doing anything about it.

Bob also hints that [Raph](Raph "wikilink") might have been kidnapped by
[The Tralü](The_Tralü "wikilink"). After having defeated The Tralü,
while Twinsen is walking with [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink"), Bob asks them about
the expectant baby that Zoé will soon be having.

When the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink") land on
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"), Bob isn't too thrilled about their
unexpected arrival.
