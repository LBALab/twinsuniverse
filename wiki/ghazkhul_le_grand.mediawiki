'''Ghazkhul le Grand''' is an Orc, a [[:Category:Mercenaries|Mercenary]], assumably also an Assassin (like the [[Money-Monkey]]) sent by Dark Monk (really [[Dr. FunFrock]]) to kill [[Twinsen]] before he could get to [[Island CX]].

The Orc is a monster larger than [[Twinsen]]. He carries a huge sword and can hit him very hard with multiple attacks (... lifepoints). He also has a considerable amount of lifepoints and that's why he is hard to kill.

He guards the [[Astrid|Queen of the Mosquibees']] throne. However, Twinsen is strong enough to be able to beat him.

The name "Ghazkul le Grand" is not mentioned in the actual game, only in the Little Big Adventure 2 website [http://www.littlebigadventure2.com/lba2/FAMILLE/OTHERSZ.HTM].
