'''Ghazkhul le Grand''' is an Orc, a Mercenary sent by Dark Monk (really [[Dr. FunFrock]]) to kill [[Twinsen]] before he could get to [[Island CX]]. He guards the [[Astrid|Queen of the Mosquibees']] throne, which is the secret entrance to Island CX. However, Twinsen is strong enough to be able to beat him and reach the island.

The name "Ghazkul le Grand" is not mentioned in the actual game, only in the Little Big Adventure 2 website [http://www.littlebigadventure2.com/lba2/FAMILLE/OTHERSZ.HTM]
