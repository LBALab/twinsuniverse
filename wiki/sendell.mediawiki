==Description==
'''Sendell''' is thought to be the goddess of [[Twinsun]], but actually there is a race of Sendells that lives in the core of Twinsun. She and other Sendells are watching over a [[Stellar Entity]] that is in gestation in the center of Twinsun.

They have been contacting [[Twinsen]]'s ancestors to preserve the [[Legend of Sendell|Legend]] that in the future will save the planet from [[FunFrock]]'s dictatorship. 

In [[Little Big Adventure|LBA]], she calls [[Twinsen]] for help in his dreams, warning him of [[Dr. FunFrock|FunFrock]]'s dictatorship. She too gives [[Twinsen]] magical powers (see [[Legend of Sendell]]). She finally tells Twinsen that Stellar Entity is watched by her and other Sendells.

In [[Little Big Adventure 2|LBA2]], she helps Twinsen defeat FunFrock and save Twinsun again.
