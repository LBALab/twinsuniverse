**Twinsen** is the hero of both adventures. Twinsen is the player
character, and navigates islands on several planets to be able to save
the planet and peace. Twinsen is the latest descendent of the family of
Quetches who was granted special powers by
[Sendell](Sendell "wikilink"), the god of [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink").

## Description

Twinsen is a young [quetch](quetch "wikilink") from [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). He
received praise and fame for freeing Twinsun from the evil dictator
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink") during his first adventure, and saving
Twinsun from destruction as well as ridding Zeelich from [Dark Monk's
curse](Dark_Monk's_curse "wikilink") during his second adventure.

Twinsen is the last person in a secret line of heirs. This line was so
secret, that Twinsen himself did not know about this until the need came
up for the heir to rise up and fight against the tyrant (FunFrock), as
forespoken in the prophecy described in the [Book of
Bù](Book_of_Bù "wikilink").

Twinsen's appearance is marked by his blue magical
[tunic](tunic "wikilink"), [Sendell's
Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink") and his [Magic
Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink"). This was his default attire throughout
most of both his adventures.

### Character

Because of his adventures and quests for the greater good, Twinsen is
well known for his courage among the people on both planets, but he
remains a modest and friendly attitude. He stands up for the common
people, as he has the strong urge in his blood to stand up against
injustice, a common trait amongst the line of heirs.

Some might say that before and during Twinsen's first adventure, Twinsen
was rather shy and perhaps softer. He became more talkative and verbal
around the time his second adventure started.

### Relations

Together with his girlfriend [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink"), Twinsen has one baby
son [Arthur](Arthur "wikilink"), who was born right after peace between
Zeelich and Twinsun was regained and the [Emerald
Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink") was pushed back.

Twinsen had many ancestors, one of which is
[Hégésippe](Hégésippe "wikilink"). Not much is known about him, and
virtually nothing about the other ancestors.

Some of Twinsen's closest friends include [Jerome
Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink") and [Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink").

Twinsen is able to communicate with [Sendell](Sendell "wikilink") from
anywhere, even from Zeelich, by means of the [Sendell's
Ball](Sendell's_Ball "wikilink") which he retrieved during his second
adventure. He has also met in person with a physical representation of
Sendell twice; at the end of both his adventures, the first of which
together with Zoé.

## Skills

Twinsen is known for his wide arrangement of athletic moves, magic
skills, and the capability to handle a large amount of different weapons
and vehicles.

### Athletics

Some observative people on Twinsun and Zeelich have noticed that Twinsen
has four basic modes of movement. Each of the most important movements
within these modes are:

- Walking, talking
- Running, jumping
- Punching and kicking
- Sneaking, crouching

### Magic skills and Magic Ball

Twinsen went through the four stages of magic throughout the first
adventure: Yellow, Green, Red and Fire. This was possible by retrieving
respectively the [Ancestral Tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink"), the
[Book of Bù](Book_of_Bù "wikilink"), then [Sendell's
Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink"), and eventually a [flask of
Clear Water](flask_of_Clear_Water "wikilink"). The [Magic
Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink") itself doubles as a weapon, and indication
of the current level of magic, given by it's colour.

Between his first and second adventure, Twinsen mostly dislearned his
magic skills, and the Magic Ball degraded back to yellow. After the need
arose to use it again, he gradually regained his magic skills throughout
his second adventure.

To regain the first level of magic, Twinsen collected the [Ancestral
Tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink") once more, along with [Sendell's
Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink"). For the second level of
magic, Twinsen had to pass three tests and gain a [Wizard's
Diploma](Wizard's_Diploma "wikilink"). The third level of magic was
gained by retrieving [Sendell's Ball](Sendell's_Ball "wikilink"), and
the fourth and final level was gained by uniting the four fragments of
the four Zeelichian races to create Dark Monks key.

### Handling weapons

Apart from his bare fists and feet, Twinsen came across and used many
weapons during his adventures which he used to his advantage. These were
used in his first adventure:

- [Magic Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink")
- [Nitro-Meca-Penguin](Nitro-Meca-Penguin "wikilink")
- [FunFrock's Saber](FunFrock's_Saber "wikilink")

Whereas during his second adventure, Twinsen got his hands on a larger
array of weapons:

- [Magic Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink")
- [Darts](Darts "wikilink")
- [Blowgun](Blowgun "wikilink"), [Blowtron](Blowtron "wikilink")
- [Nitro-Meca-Penguin](Nitro-Meca-Penguin "wikilink")
- [Laser-pistol](Laser-pistol "wikilink")
- [Wannies Glove](Wannies_Glove "wikilink")
- [Emperor's Sword](Emperor's_Sword "wikilink")

### Handling vehicles

Twinsen handled a large amount of vehicles during his adventures.
Following is a summary of the means of transportation handled by Twinsen
during his first adventure:
