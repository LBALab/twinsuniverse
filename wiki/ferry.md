**Ferries** in the [Little Big
Adventure](Little_Big_Adventure "wikilink") games are used as services
between [Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink") and later the [Island of the White
Leaf Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"). Passengers
have to buy a [ferry ticket](ferry_ticket "wikilink") to board.

In [Little Big Adventure 2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"), the old,
white ferry had been replaced with a new yellow one resembling a
hovercraft. During the time of the [Esmer
invasion](Esmer_invasion "wikilink"), the ferry services are not
allowed.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") has to use the ferries several times
during his adventures. He first needs it to get to [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"). As the
[rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") at the ferry ticket store recognizes
him as the wanted refugee, however, he has to buy fake ferry tickets
from a [grobo](grobo "wikilink"). He first has to help the grobo moving
around crates in the nearby [warehouse](warehouse "wikilink"). He later
buys his [catamaran](catamaran "wikilink"), enabling to move around
freely on [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink")'s [Southern
Hemisphere](Southern_Hemisphere "wikilink") without having to use the
ferry service.

In LBA 2, Twinsen uses the ferry to get to the [Island of the White Leaf
Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink") while his
[Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink") is injured. When he heals him with the
[Horn of the Blue Triton](Horn_of_the_Blue_Triton "wikilink"), he is
able to freely move around on Twinsun again.
