==Description==
'''Nurses''' are [[quetch]]es working in [[FunFrock]]'s factories and prisons. Their basic job is to keep an eye on prisoners. However, they also do researches in the [[mutant factory]] and the [[Teleportation Center]].

Nurses are always seen in the basic white nurse outfit. It is forbidden to travel in the nurse outfit outside the prisons and factories, but a [[Teleportation Center guard|nurse]] is seen outside in a white clothing guarding the entrance of the [[Teleportation Center]].

Nurses sometimes carry weapons like a truncheon or a gun.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]] had to fight nurses at several places, as in the [[Citadel]], the [[mutant factory]], the [[Teleportation Center]], [[FunFrock's secret fortress]] and many more. Whenever a nurse encountered Twinsen, it would run to the nearest alarm button calling a [[Supergro]].

In order to escape from the [[Citadel]], he had to take on a nurse's clothing as a disguise.
