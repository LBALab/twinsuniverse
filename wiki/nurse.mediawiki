<center>''This article is about [[Quetch]] nurses. For [[Grobo]] nurses equipped with tablet launchers, see [[Supergro]].''</center>


'''Nurses''' are [[quetch]]es working in [[FunFrock]]'s factories and prisons. Their basic job is to keep an eye on prisoners. However, they also do researches in the [[mutant factory]] and the [[Teleportation Center]].

Nurses are always seen in the basic white nurse outfit. It is forbidden to travel in the nurse outfit outside the prisons and factories, although a [[Teleportation Center guard|nurse]] is seen outside in a white clothing guarding the entrance of the [[Teleportation Center]].

Nurses sometimes carry weapons like a truncheon or a gun.

[[Twinsen]] has to fight nurses at several places, as in the [[Citadel]], the [[mutant factory]], the [[Teleportation Center]] or [[FunFrock's secret fortress]]. Whenever a nurse encounters Twinsen, it runs to the nearest alarm button calling a [[Supergro]].

In order to escape from the [[Citadel]], Twinsen has to take on a nurse's clothing as a disguise.
