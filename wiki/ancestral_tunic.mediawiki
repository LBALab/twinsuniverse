==Description==
The '''Ancestral Tunic''', as described in the [[Book of Bu]], was one of the four items required by the Heir to be collected for him to ensure victory against the designated tyrant. This magical tunic was kept for centuries upon centuries in a secret closet at the house of the Heir's acnestors, and kept it safe for the time when the Chosen One will be needing it.

This Ancestral Tunic, as suggested earlier, is a great source of magic. Whoever wears it, in a way that every tunic is being worn, is able to store an enormous amount of [[magic power]], which is vital for defeating his enemies. The amount of magic available for storage depneds on the owner's level of magic, and can range from Yellow to Fire.

Combined with the [[Magic Ball]], which was also kept in the secret closet at The Heir's house, these 
two magical items make together an extremely powerful combination, which would almost certainly ensure anyone success in his mission.

The tunic is coloured blue, probably to symbolize the close relationships with the [[Sendell|Sendells]] and [[the legend]], who are also blue. Additionally, blue is a colour of hope, which might be another explanation for the colour choice.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
Escaping from the [[Citadel]] at the very beginnig of his first adventure, [[Twinsen]] made it to [[Twinsen's house|his and Zoe's house]]. Before he managed to do anything, two [[grobo clones]] knocked on the door, and captured [[Zoe]] just after Twinsen managed to hide. After their disappearance, it took Twinsen a little exploration around the house to find what he was looking for- the closet at which the Ancestral Tunic, as well as the magic ball, was kept. Putting it on, Twinsen immediately became powerful, as he was now able to store magic, thus using his magic ball. This tunic, which Twinsen kept until the end of his adventure, proved very powerful, and ensured Twinsen his success in defeating the evil [[FunFrock]].

At the end of his first adventure, Twinsen has contributed the tunic to [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum|Ms. Bloop's growing museum]], which might have indicated that he was prepared to rest a bit from adventures for the close while. He has also left a note in his house to his future descendants:
{{Quote|
Quote=To my future descendants: I have lent to Miss Bloop's private museum, the Medallion and the Ancestral Tunic which rightfully belong to you.|
Character=Signed: Twinsen.}}

However, having to free [[Raph]] the [[lighthouse]] keeper, and, later on, the entire planet, Twinsen very quickly found the tunic necessary again. Going to the museum to reclaim the tunic, he found out that the room at which the button that opens the tunic's safe was locked. To get in, our hero had to sneak in through the museum's window, and thus opening the tunic's safe.

Just like at his first adventure, the tunic was Twinsen's primary object he carried with him, along with his magic ball. Apart from a short time, at which he walked around the planets with a [[Wizard's Parade Tunic]], Twinsen carried the Ancestral Tunic with him until the end of his adventure, when he defeated, perhaps for the last time, the evil FunFrock.

Character=When Twinsen found the tunic in his house}}
{{Quote|
Quote=The day will come when someone from the present or future species will rise up and say, 'This world is mine from now on, and the key to all powers belongs to me!' This day will surely come because avarice and violence harbor in the hearts of all species of the universe. If the peril on this day is too great, the Chosen One will come forth. He will rise up against the tyrant and overthrow him. He will free and reunite the people, because throughout the years, the Chosen One's ancestors will have prepared him for his victory. They will have left information and weapons in his dwelling. The Chosen One, also known as the Heir, will, however, have to gather together four magical symbols if he hopes to be victorious: the Tunic, the Book of Bu, Sendell's Medallion and a Flask of Clear Water. On the day of peril Sendell will visit the Heir in his sleep and announce the coming of the final combat. The Heir will then have to go to the Well of Sendell where the goddess will endow her powers on him!|
