The '''rebels''' were inhabitants of [[Twinsun]] who opposed Dr [[Funfrock]] with military force. They retreated to the [[Rebellion Island]] which was constantly bombed by Funfrock's forces. Their island was isolated and they allowed access to their [[Rebellion Island Harbour|harbour]] only to ships bearing a [[pirate flag]].

The rebels intended to traverse the fortified [[Okojo Pass]] but during their attempt, their coloner [[Kroptman]] was captured
