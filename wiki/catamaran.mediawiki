==Description==
The '''catamaran''' is a yellow boat owned by [[Twinsen]]. He uses it to get from one island to another on [[Twinsun]]'s [[Southern Hemisphere]], next to his [[Dino-Fly]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Twinsen bought the catamaran from a [[sphero]] sailor at [[Port-Belooga]] during his first adventure for 200 [[Kash]]es. He needed it to get to islands that were not available via [[ferry]] or the [[Fisherman]]'s boat. He used it to get to [[Proxima Island]] and the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

He later attached a [[pirate flag]] he had stolen from the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxim-City]] to the catamaran, and thus was allowed to dock on [[Rebellion Island]].
