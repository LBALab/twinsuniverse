[[Image:Catamara.gif|right|199px|thumb|The catamaran with the [[pirate flag]] attached.]]

The '''catamaran''' is a yellow boat owned by [[Twinsen]] in Little Big Adventure 1. He uses it to get from one island to another on [[Twinsun]]'s [[Southern Hemisphere]].

Twinsen buys the catamaran from a [[sphero]] sailor at [[Port-Belooga]] for 200 [[Kash]]es. He needs it to get to islands that are not available via [[ferry]] or the [[Fisherman]]'s boat, such as [[Proxima Island]] or the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

By attaching a [[pirate flag]] he stole from the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxim-City]] to the catamaran, Twinsen gives a proof of his good intentions to the [[rebel]]s on [[Rebellion Island]], and is thus able to dock there.
