The **Elves Club Blue Card** is a blue card coated with star powder. It
is a proof that the owner is officially a part of the
[Elves](Elf "wikilink") Club. It also enables opening some gates around
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") receives the card from [Joe the
Elf](Joe_the_Elf "wikilink"), after finding him in a labyrinth in
[Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink"). The card guarantees him an
entrance to the Elves Club, as the fourth member there. Later on, after
finding and releasing [Raymond the Elf](Raymond_the_Elf "wikilink"),
Twinsen receives from him some [clover leafs](clover_leaf "wikilink") as
gratitude when showing him the card. Twinsen also needs the card in
order to open specific gates around Twinsun, especially in the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink") area.
