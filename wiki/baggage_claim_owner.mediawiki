The '''baggage claim owner''' is a nameless [[grobo]] who owns the [[Baggage Claim]] on [[Citadel Island]].

Twinsen can enter the baggage claim in the beginning of the game, but has no business there first, and the owner does not let him into the basement.

When Twinsen comes there to claim his [[proto-pack]], the owner lets him in, and instructs him how to take the proto-pack. When Twinsen or [[Carlo (Baggage Claim)|Carlo]] bring the proto-pack back to the reception, the owner opens the crate, and Twinsen can then take the proto-pack.
