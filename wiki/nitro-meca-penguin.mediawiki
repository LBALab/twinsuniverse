'''Nitro-Meca-Penguin''' is a weapon available in [[Little Big Adventure 2]]. Those penguins are similar to the [[Meca-Penguins]] used in [[Little Big Adventure 1]], although slightly different. Once such a penguin is launched, it moves a few inches forward, and explodes 5 seconds after, creating some damage around its explosion point.

Nitro-Meca-Penguins can be found in some shops, as well as in hidden places around [[Twinsun]] and [[Zeelich]]. One room in [[Dark Monk's Temple]] is full of these penguins. It is possible to possess a maximum of 10 penguins at a time.
