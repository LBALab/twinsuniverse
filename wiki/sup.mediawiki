This humanoid race has a huge head and a tiny body. The Sups live mainly on the island of Otringal. They are the intellectual elite of the planet Zeelich where they dominate the other races, imposing their iron rule on all and sundry in the name of their Emperor. Their advanced technology allows them to travel from galaxy to galaxy and attempt to populate other planets. The Emperor and DarkMonk appear to maintain excellent relations...
