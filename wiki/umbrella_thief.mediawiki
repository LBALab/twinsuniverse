==Description==

The '''Umbrella Thief''' is a rabbibunny who steals an [[umbrella]] from the [[pharmacy]] on [[Citadel Island]] during [[Twinsen's Odyssey]]. He has a little sister at the [[Schoolhouse]] and a [[Mrs. Brune|mother]] who works at the [[Inter-Islands Ferry]].

[[Twinsen]] is asked to retrieve the umbrella back from the rabbibunny thief, by the [[Leone|owner of the umbrella]], who was a customer at the pharmacy.

==Role in Twinsen's Adventure==

To get information out of the owner of the umbrella about [[Ker'aooc]], Twinsen had to go after the thief, in discreet mode to make him give the umbrella back. Apparently it was just an 'accident.'
