**Leopold** is a camel living on the [Island of the White Leaf
Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"). He is seen near the
[Hacienda](Hacienda "wikilink") with his [grobo](grobo "wikilink")
owner. Leopold claims to be imported. He loves sand roses which he gets
from his owner.

Leopold has no role in the game, and talking with him is not vital.
