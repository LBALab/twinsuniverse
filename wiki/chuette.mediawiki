'''Chuette''' is a little yellow mechanical owl that wanders around [[Franco Village]] on the [[Island of the Francos]]. It has a small den next to [[Roger de la Fontaine's house]]. The only thing it says is "Biddy Biddy". The [[dog]] that lives on the island also dislikes the owl, because it hides in one of it's niches.

This owl seems to be of a thieving nature, as a [[franco child]] in the local franco [[kindergarten]] tells [[Twinsen]] it took the key to his house. Following the owl, Twinsen arrives to his nest, where he finds the [[Burgermaster's Key]]. Twinsen uses this key to open he cupboard holding the [[Burgermaster's Notes]].

If Twinsen sets off a [[Nitro-Meca-Penguin]] near the owl, little hearts float up from it.
