'''Chuette''' is a mechanical owl walking around the [[Franco Village]]. It has a small den next to [[Roger de la Fontaine's house]].

This owl seems to be of a thieving nature, and one [[franco]] child in the local [[kindergarten]] blames him for stealing the key to his house. Following the owl, [[Twinsen]] arrives to his nest, where he finds the [[burgermaster's key]]. Twinsen uses this key to open he cupboard holding the [[burgermaster's notes]].

If Twinsen sets off a [[Nitro-Meca-Penguin]] near the owl, little hearts float up from it.
