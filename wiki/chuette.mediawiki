== '''Description''' ==

The mechanical owl is the one who stole the key from a little Francos child in the school.  It had no role in Twinsen's adventure.
== '''Trivia''' ==

If Twinsen set off a Nitro Mecha-Penguin near the owl, little hearts would float up from the owl.

== '''Quotes''' ==
"I won't talk!! My parents put me here to punish me 'cause I lost the key to our house.  It wasn't my fault, that thief of an owl took it from me.  That filthy mechanical owl!! And it's not a loser like you who's going to help me!!"
