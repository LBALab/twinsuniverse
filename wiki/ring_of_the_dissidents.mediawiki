The '''Ring of the Dissidents''' is a ring used as an identification sign of the [[Zeelich]]ian [[dissidents]], the small group opossing the [[Emperor]] and [[Dark Monk]]. This ring is a proof that the owner is to be trusted by them.

In the conversation with [[Johnny Rocket]] in the [[Imperial Hotel]], [[Twinsen]] receives from him the Dissidents Ring, which Johnny instructs him to show to the seller at the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]]. After Twinsen shows him the ring, the seller opens a secret door in his shop, which leads down to the basement. There, Twinsen meets the dissidents, who instruct him about finding [[Island CX]].

Later, in the [[Island of the Mosquibees]], [[Queen Astrid]] asks Twinsen for a proof of his good intentions. Twinsen does so by showing her the ring.

If [[Twinsen]] shows the ring to the clerk of the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]] after returning from [[Island CX]], the Clerk turns out to be an imposter, and shouts for the [[Franco guard]]s.
