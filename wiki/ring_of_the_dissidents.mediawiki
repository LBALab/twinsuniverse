Character=Official description}}

==Description==
This '''ring''' is the identification sign of the [[Zeelich|Zeelichian]] dissidents, the small group opossing the [[Emperor]] and [[Dark Monk]]. It's the proof that the owner is to be trusted by the them. For this reason, this ring is only given to trusty people.

The ring looks rather expensive, with a round ring of gold, and a diamond on top.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]] needed to get to [[Island CX]] in order to prevent the [[Emerald Moon]] to hurl towards [[Twinsun]]. Following the advice of [[Johnny Rocket]], Twinsen went to meet the dissidents, a rebellistic group against the Emperor of Zeelich. Johnny sent Twinsen to the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]], along with the ring of the dissidents. Upon showing the ring to the shop seller, Twinsen was brought into the secret basement of the shop, where he met the dissidents. After a short discussion with them, it was agreed that Twinsen should try reaching Island CX through the [[Mosquibees Island]].

Once reaching the Island of the Mosquibees, Twinsen met the [[Queen Astrid]]. Not trusting anyone easily, the suspicious queen asked Twinsen for a proof of his trustworthiness. Still owning the ring, Twinsen was able to convince Astrid of his good purposes, by showing it to her. Twinsen then had to pass the [[Mosquibees Challenge]] in order to proceed in his adventure.

==Trivia==
If [[Twinsen]] showed the ring to the clerk of the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]] after returning from [[Island CX]], the Clerk would turn out to be an imposter and would shout for the [[Police]].
