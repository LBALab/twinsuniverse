The '''memory viewer''' is an object showing videos seen in the game previously. This viewer is a small, red, binocular-like device.

[[Twinsen]] can pick up the memory viewer in [[Jerome Baldino's residence (Port-Ludo)|Jerome Baldino's house]], although he doesn't have to use it at any specific point of the game. This viewer can be found there only after the [[Esmers]] take control of [[Twinsun]], and Baldino leaves for [[Emerald Moon]]. Subsequently, Twinsen can buy one at the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]] in [[Otringal]], for 30 [[zlitos]].
