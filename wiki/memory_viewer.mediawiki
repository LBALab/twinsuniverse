==Description==
The memory viewer enables viewing certain experiences in the owner's life. This is a small red binoculars device.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The memory viewer did not play a vital role in [[Twinsen]]'s adventure, but it could come in handy at some points. With it, Twinsen could view movies he experienced earlier in his adventure. Twinsen could find this viewer in [[Baldino's house]] after the [[Esmers]] invaded the planet, or at the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]] on [[Otringal]], available for 30 zlitos.
