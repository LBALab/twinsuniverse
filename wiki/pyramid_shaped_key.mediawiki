The '''Pyramid shaped key''' is a key the shape of a pyramid openning the secret room in the [[Citadel Island sewers|sewers of Citadel Island]], where [[Sendell's Ball]] is surrounded by a cage of ice.

The key was kept by [[Mies van Der Rooh's father]], the old [[rabbibunny]] who lives next to [[Twinsen]] on [[Bug Street]]. After Twinsen gives his neighbour a [[flask of gallic acid]], he is able to use it to restore a map of the sewers. This map turns out to mention the key, which the rabbibunny gives to Twinsen.

Twinsen uses this key with the keyhole on the floor in [[Green Corulla Street]], which makes the door to the secret room open.
