'''Rosa-Marie''' is a cow eating grass on the [[cliffs]] of [[Citadel Island]], near the [[Ruins of the Old Citadel]].

[[Twinsen]] can ask Rosa-Marie whether she has seen [[Raph]], the [[lighthouse]] keeper, and she replies she saw him with his guitar, heading to the cliffs. Later, when the [[esmer]]s land on [[Twinsun]], Rosa-Marie warns Twinsen that one armed [[sup]] is hiding behind the trees.

If Twinsen goes behind Rosa-Marie and paces forward for a while, he gets a [[clover leaf]] from her. This can be done an unlimited number of times.
