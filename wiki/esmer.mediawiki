'''Esmers''' is a general name for the inhabitants of [[Zeelich]] used by [[Twinsun]]ians. It is based on the Twinsunians' initial belief that the "Esmers" come from [[Emerald Moon]] instead of Zeelich (Esmers = people from Emerald Moon). But despite better knowing it has evolved to meaning Zeelichians, as even [[FunFrock]], knowing their origins from the first time, uses the term "Esmers". The Esmers themselves prefer the name Zeelichians.

The Esmers are actually four different species: the [[Sup]]s, the [[Franco]]s, the [[Wannie]]s and the [[Mosquibee]]s. The term "race" is also often used to describe differences, though the official term is species.

The term Esmer can be found next to any activities and objects by Zeelichans, as far as they are known or happened on Twinsun.

==The Esmer invasion==
:''Main Article: [[Esmer invasion]]''
A part of FunFrock's and the [[Emperor]]'s plan to destory [[Twinsun]] needed the power of the Twinsunian wizards. Realising that it wouldn't be easy to get control on them, they started a mission to Twinsun, inviting the wizards to [[Zeelich]].

Pretending they wanted to help with the restoration of the [[Temple of BÃ¹]], they build a [[Esmer base|secret base]] in [[Bald Mountain]] for their shuttles to land and get off. Agents of the SBI are sent to remote places of the islands.

As the Emsers can't just leave Twinsun after capturing the wizards, they establish military control over the populace instead.

During the military presence of the Esmers on [[Twinsun]] Esmer troops and robots are guarding the streets, many public places such [[Chez Luc]] and [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum]] are closed, along with the [[ferry]] services.

Mine fields are seen on [[Desert Island]], making it hard to use the guarded streets.

With the prepared destruction of Twinsun with the [[Emerald Moon base|lunar reactors]], however, more and more Esmers leave the planet, bringing themselves out of danger.

==Esmer Spaceships==

:''Main Article: [[Esmer shuttle]]''

The yellow Esmer spaceships can usually be found at the [[astroport]] in [[Otringal]], carrying passengers to various planets. However, they are also used for military purposes, like for the invasion of [[Twinsun]], at the [[Emerald Moon base]], or as the [[Emperor]]'s personal spacecraft to get from [[Island CX]] to [[Otringal]].

The shuttles' round outside makes them perfectly able to fly through space. Upon landing, big red feet extend from its bottom, and a side door opens.

The shuttles are controlled by [[itinary token]]s.
