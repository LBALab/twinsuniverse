==Origin of the name==
'''Esmers''' is a general name for the inhabitants of [[Zeelich]] used by twinsunians. It may have been a word describing extratwinsunians in general, but has evolved to meaning only Zeelichians. The esmers themselves prefer the name Zeelichians.

==The Esmer invasion==
A part of [[FunFrock]]'s and the [[Emperor]]'s plan to destory [[Twinsun]] needed the power of the Twinsunian wizards. Realising that it wouldn't be easy to get control on them, they started a mission to Twinsun, inviting the wizards to [[Zeelich]].

Pretending they wanted to help with the restoration of the [[Temple of BÃ¹]], they built a [[Esmer base|secret base]] in [[Bald Mountain]] for their shuttles to land and get off. Agents of the SBI were sent to remote places of the islands.

As the Emsers couldn't just leave Twinsun after capturing the wizards, they established military control over the populace instead. This military force was called the Esmer troops.

During the military presence of the Esmers on [[Twinsun]] Esmer troops and robots were guarding the streets, many public places, like [[Chez Luc]] and [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum]] were closed, along with the ferry service.

Mine fields were seen on [[Desert Island]] making it hard not to use the guarded streets.

With the prepared destruction of Twinsun with the [[Emerald Moon base|lunar reactors]], however, more and more Esmers left the planet, bringing themselves out of danger.
