== Description ==
Franckie is the owner of the [[Franckie's|bar]] on the [[Island of the Francos]]. During the search for the [[Francos fragment]], Franckie didn't refused to participate in the treasure hunt, claiming he did not believe in all those stories. However, being the owner of the only pub on the island, he was able to use the search for his own benefit, and during that period his business blossomed.
