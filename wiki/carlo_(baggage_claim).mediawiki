'''Carlo''' is a [[Quetch]] working as a porter in the [[Baggage Claim]] of [[Citadel Island]]. His job is to carry packages from the storage room to the reception.

[[Twinsen]] meets Carlo at the baggage claim storage room, when he comes there in order to collect his [[proto-pack]]. Carlo suggests Twinsen to carry the crate for him, for the fee of 102 [[kashes]]. Twinsen can choose whether to pay him, or to push the crate himself.

A secret room in the building holds a crate containing 102 kashes, exactly the sum required to pay Carlo.
