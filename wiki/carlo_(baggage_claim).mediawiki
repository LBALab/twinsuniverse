Age=Adult}}

Carlo is a lazy-looking [[Quetch]] working at the [[Baggage Claim]] of [[Citadel Island]]. He is willing to do hard work once in a while, but only for a lot of money.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
When [[Twinsen]] had to get the crate which contained the [[proto-pack]] to the reception, Carlo offered to help for a certain price. Twinsen could let Carlo do the job, what would have costed him 102 [[Kashes]].

==Trivia==
Searching further in the building, Twinsen was able to find a secret room, at which he found exactly the money he needed to pay Carlo.
