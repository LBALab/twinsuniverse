'''Chedil Amiradoo''' is a [[rabbibunny]] who makes living from selling various magic accessories to fully licensed wizards. Throughout Little Big Adventure 2, he circles around the [[White Leaf Desert]] on his magical flying carpet. People who wish to buy goods from him are required to show him their [[wizard's diploma]], as a proof of them being fully licensed.

Upon qualifying from the [[School of Magic]], [[Twinsen]] is advised by the [[mentor of the school of magic|mentor of the school]] to go meet Chedil Amiradoo, and buy a [[wizard's parade tunic]] from him. Once bumping into him in the desert, Twinsen shows him his newly given wizard's diploma, as a proof of his wizardry. In return to 50 [[kashes]] Twinsen receives a parade tunic and a fake wizard beard.

Twinsen can also buy [[Orange Powder]] from Chedil.

When Twinsen comes back from [[Zeelich]] for the first time, Chedil is no longer seen around the island.
