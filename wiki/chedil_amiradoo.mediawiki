'''Chedil Amiradoo''' is a [[rabbibunny]] peddler on [[Desert Island]] who makes living from selling various magic accessories to fully licensed wizards. Throughout [[Twinsen's Odyssey]], he circles around the [[White Leaf Desert]] on his magical flying carpet. People who wish to buy goods from him are required to show him their [[Wizard's Diploma]], as a proof of them being fully licensed.

Upon qualifying from the [[School of Magic]], [[Twinsen]] is advised by the [[Rector of the School of Magic|rector of the school]] to go meet Chedil Amiradoo, and buy a [[Wizard's Parade Tunic]] from him. Once bumping into him in the desert, Twinsen shows him his newly given wizard's diploma, as a proof of his wizardry. In return to 50 [[kashes]] Twinsen receives a parade tunic and a fake wizard beard.

Twinsen can also buy [[Orange Powder]] from Chedil, and he also gives Twinsen a hint as to where the wizards are going with the [[Esmer]]s.

When Twinsen comes back from [[Zeelich]] for the first time, Chedil is no longer seen around the island.
