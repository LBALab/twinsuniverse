**Yellow Rabbibunny Clones** are weak clones created by [Dr.
FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink"). They are in use for basic guarding
and overseeing activities, but are not capable of fighting a stronger
enemy, as they collapse when hit. They can be met patrolling in
[Lupin-Burg](Lupin-Burg "wikilink") or the [Old
Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink"), or at the [Principal Island
harbour](Principal_Island_harbour "wikilink"). There is also one at
[FunFrock's Headquarters](FunFrock's_Headquarters "wikilink"), more
guarding the nearby street than the fortress.

In order to get the trust of the [Old Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink")
inhabitants, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") has to clobber a clone. The
only clones in the Old Burg he is capable of fighting against at that
time were the patrolling yellow rabbibunny clones. Once he defeats one
of them, he is helped by the inhabitants, and eventually reaches [Bob
Vortix's house](Bob_Vortix's_house "wikilink").
