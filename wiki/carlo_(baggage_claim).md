**Carlo** is a [Quetch](Quetch "wikilink") working as a porter in the
[Baggage Claim](Baggage_Claim "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). His job is to carry packages from
the storage room to the reception.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") meets Carlo at the baggage claim storage
room, when he comes there in order to collect his
[proto-pack](proto-pack "wikilink"). Carlo offers to take
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s crate up to the entrance if he is paid a
fee of 102 [kashes](kashes "wikilink"). Twinsen can choose whether to
pay him, or to push the crate himself.

A secret room in the building holds a box containing 102 kashes, exactly
the sum required to pay Carlo.
