'''Supergros''' are white [[grobo]] [[clones]]. They are armed with tablet launchers with which they can put anyone they hit to sleep. These people can then be brought to the nearest [[prison]]. They can be found in every prison and would teleport out of a [[telepod]] when alarmed by a [[nurse]]. Some can also be seen guarding the upper areas of [[Old Burg]], or [[FunFrock's Headquarters]].

[[Twinsen]] is not able to face the supergros for a long time, and each time he meets one of them, he is instantly carried to the nearest prison. However, after he gets the last level of magic with the [[flask of clear water]], he is able to fight them. Then, they no longer shoot sleeping tablets, but deadly red projectiles, which can kill Twinsen in three hits.

Twinsen has to fight a supergro in the entrance of [[FunFrock's Headquarters]], to get the [[key]] to enter it.
