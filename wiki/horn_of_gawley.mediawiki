==Description==
'''The Gawley's Horn''' is an object left for [[Legend of Sendell|The Heir]] by his ancestors in a secret cave behind his house. It allows the person using it to break open the seals of [[Sendell]], which will lead to a new place. To use the horn, the person must blow it towards a Seal of Sendell.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]] found the Horn of Gawley (along with [[Sendell's Medallion]]) in the hidden cave behind his house, to which he could enter after retrieving [[Key to the Heir's room|LeBorgne's key]] from the [[Maritime Museum]]. He had a chance to use the horn right after finding it, on a Sendell's Seal that was found in the room.

Even though behind most seals he found only [[clover leaves]], some seals were necessary for him to go through. For example, he had to use the horn on the Sendell's Seal in [[Desert Island]], so that he can meet [[Joe the Elf]] and get the [[Elves Club card]]. Another example is near one of the [[Runic Stones]] in [[Proxima Island]], where Twinsen had to blow the horn so that he could get to the stone.
