'''Mr. Bazoo''' is a [[grobo]] owning the [[Mr. Bazoo's Shop|shop]] in [[Lupin-Burg]] on [[Citadel Island]].

[[Twinsen]] can buy from Mr. Bazoo [[Nitro-Meca-Penguin]]s, [[Dart]]s, [[Life Candy|Life Points]] and [[Flask of Magic Powder|Magic Points]].

There is a way that enables robbing the money box in the shop, as well as gaining unlimited Nitro-Meca-Penguins. If Twinsen launches a penguin in the shop, Mr. Bazoo gets scared and runs away. Twinsen can then steal some [[kashes]] from the cash register, and also take penguins and darts for free.
