==Description==
Mr. Bazoo has a [[Mr. Bazoo's Shop|bazaar]] on [[Citadel Island]]. He sells there all the usual stuff found at any other shop, but at lower prices than elsewhere.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Whenever [[Twinsen]] needed [[Nitro-Meca Penguins]], [[Darts]] or [[life points|life]] or [[magic points]], he could come over to Mr. Bazooâ€™s shop and buy them there.

==Trivia==
Messing around with the Nitro-Meca Penguin he bought, Twinsen caused it to explode, what made Mr. Bazoo run away. Seeing that the shop was left empty, Twinsen then robbed the shop of all the penguins he wanted.
