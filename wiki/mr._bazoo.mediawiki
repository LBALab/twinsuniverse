'''Mr. Bazoo''' is a [[grobo]] owning the [[Mr. Bazoo's Shop|shop]] in [[Lupin-Burg]].

[[Twinsen]] can buy from Mr. Bazoo [[Nitro-Meca Penguins]], [[Darts]], [[life points]] and [[magic points]]. Bazoo and his shop, however, do not play a vital part of the game.

One cheat enables robbing the money box in the shop, as well as gaining unlimited Nitro-Meca-Penguins. If Twinsen launches a penguin in the shop, Mr. Bazoo gets scared and runs away. Twinsen can then steal some [[kashes]] from the shop, and also take penguins and darts for free.
