The '''mentor of the school of magic''' is a nameless [[rabbibunny]] who is in charge of the [[School of Magic]]. He guides the new pupils of the school throughout their tests, and gives them their rewards when they complete them. He is assisted by a rabbibunny named [[Bunny]].

[[Twinsen]], knowing he has to cure his [[Dino-Fly]], enrols in the School of Magic, and is guided by the Mentor through his tests. The Mentor gives Twinsen his rewards after completing each of the tests: a [[blowgun]] after completing the [[magic ball]] test, a [[magic slate]] for the test of the [[Dome of the Slate]] and a [[wizard's diploma]] upon graduation.

After Twinsen completes his studies in the school, the mentor tells him that all the wizards of the planet disappeared. He asks Twinsen to go finding their trails.

After Twinsen comes back from [[Zeelich]], [[Zoe]] tells him about the kidnapping of the Twinsunian children by the [[Esmers]], and advices him to ask for assistance in the School of Magic. The mentor of the school tells Twinsen that in order to deal with the Esmers, he should first increase his magic level, by obtaining the [[Ball of Sendell]]. He tells him that he needs the [[Ring of Lightning]] for that.
