The mentor of the school of magic is a nameless rabbibunny who is in charge of the [[School of Magic]]. He guides the new pupils of the school throughout their tests, and gives them their rewards in case they complete one. He is also one of the most respected wizards with his own charming [[Bunny|assistant]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]], knowing he had to cure the [[Dino-Fly]], enrolled in the School of Magic, and was guided by the Mentor through his tests. The Mentor gave Twinsen his rewards after completing each of the tests.

Later on, when the [[Esmers]] invaded the planet, the mentor of the school was also the one who sent Twinsen to look for the missing wizards, and adviced him about certain things.

Quote=Welcome, Twinsen. I'd be honored to have you study with us. But even, though you once saved our world, you'll still have to pass the same tests as the other students.|

Quote=To practice for your Blowgun Test, simply go through this door at the back of this room. You'll then have a limited time to shoot all the targets. For the Test of the Balsam, you'll have to fetch me a balsam! It's a rare plant which grows in the desert. For the Test of the Slate, you must go to the island called the Dome of the Slate, a stone's throw away from Citadel Island.|

Quote=Bravo Twinsen. You now bear the title of wizard. I don't have any spare wizard's parade tunics left. But there is a peddler on the island. I'll contact him and ask him to give you one. Go find him. Also, let your beard grow.|

Quote=Shortly after FunFrock's disappearance, it was hidden on Citadel Island by the Weather Wizard. He placed it in a cage of ice which he then bound with a powerful spell. According to him, only the power of lightning is capable of freeing the ball.|
