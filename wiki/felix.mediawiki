'''Felix''' is a [[rabbibunny]] spotted in the [[Citadel Island Harbour|harbour]] of [[Citadel Island]]. During the beginning of [[Little Big Adventure 2]] he is seen fishing at the harbour, and from time to time catching [[crabs]].

Felix is not a vital part of the game, and he is only able to give [[Twinsen]] some clues about the [[Tralü]] or about [[Raph]]. Beating the crabs Felix catches grants Twinsen [[life candies]] and [[kashes]].

When Twinsen hits Felix, the rabbibunny drops his fishing pole, runs to the water and dives in. He disappears from the scene, and is only back when Twinsen re-enters the harbour.
