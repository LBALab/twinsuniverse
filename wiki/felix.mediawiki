'''Felix''' is a [[rabbibunny]] spotted in the [[Citadel Island Harbour|harbour]] of [[Citadel Island]]. During the start of [[Twinsen's Odyssey]] he is seen fishing at the harbour, and from time to time catching [[crab]]s.

He lives in great fear of [[The Tralü]], the monster of Citadel Island, that lives in a cave near the cliffs. As soon as [[Twinsen]] mentions the Tralü when Felix is around, he freaks out.

Felix is only able to give Twinsen some clues about the Tralü or about [[Raph]]. Beating the crabs Felix catches grants Twinsen [[life candies]] and [[kashes]].

When Twinsen hits Felix, the rabbibunny drops his fishing pole, runs to the water and dives in. He disappears from the scene, and is only back when Twinsen re-enters the harbour.
