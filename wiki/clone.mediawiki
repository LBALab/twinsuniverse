{{twinsunica import}}'''Clones''' are robots created by [[Dr. FunFrock]], that are designed to look like a representative of one of the [[Twinsun]]ian [[:Category: Twinsunian Species|races]]. They are created in the Cloning Center, which is located in the inside of [[FunFrock's Secret Fortress]]. The clones are then sent to the [[Teleportation Center]] on [[Brundle Island]], where they can be teleported to one of the many [[telepod]]s around the planet.

Red clones have an unexplainable hatred against [[Meca-Penguin]]s. In Little Big Adventure 2, all clones hated [[Nitro-Meca-Penguin]]s.

Clones are enemies to [[Twinsen]] throughout Little Big Advnture 1. He has to fight them at many different occasions. The Supergros pose a great threat to Twinsen, as they are able to send him to prison. The [[Dr. FunFrock]] Twinsen fought was a clone.

In Little Big Adventure 2, Twinsen has to fight clones in [[Dark Monk's statue]].
