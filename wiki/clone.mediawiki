Quote=He has at his disposal two high tech weapons that insure his power: cloning and teleportation. He can clone any of the species at will, and subsequently recruit these clones into his ranks. He can then deploy these clones instantly through a network of telepods that are dispersed over the entire planet.|
Character=Introduction}}

== Description ==
'''Clones''' are robots created by [[Dr. FunFrock]], that are designed to look like a representative of one of the [[Twinsun]]ian [[:Category: Twinsunian Species|races]]. They are created in the Cloning Center, which is located in the inside of [[FunFrock's Secret Fortress]]. The clones are then sent to the [[Teleportation Center]] on [[Brundle Island]], where they can be teleported to one of the many [[telepod]]s around the planet.

Red clones have an unexplainable hatred against [[Meca-Penguin]]s. In Twinsen's second adventure, all clones hated [[Nitro-Meca-Penguin]]s.

== Role in Twinsen's Adventures ==
Clones where enemies to [[Twinsen]] throughout his first adventure. He had to fight them at many different occasions. The Supergros posed a great threat to Twinsen, as they were able to send him to prison.

During his second adventure, Twinsen had to fight clones in [[Dark Monk's statue]].
