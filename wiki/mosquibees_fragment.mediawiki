The '''Mosquibees Fragment''' is one of the four fragments which together summon [[Dark Monk's statue]] to complete the ceremony. This turns [[Zeelich]] back to its original look after 10,000 ceremonies. The Mosquibees Fragment is the yellow "left" piece of [[Dark Monk's Key]].

The fragment itself is stored inside a locked box, on an [[Platform Ring|island isolated from the Mosquibees Village]], to prevent the [[emperor]] and his soldiers from stealing it.

As a part of his quest of hunting down the four key fragments, [[Twinsen]] reaches the [[Island of the Mosquibees]], in a search for their fragment. Just after he completes the [[Test of Truth]], the emperor's soldiers invade the [[Mosquibee Village|village]]. Twinsen manages to escape, and goes to the island isolated from the village, where the fragment is found.

On the island, Twinsen finds a box in which the Mosquibees Fragment is kept. He has to battle a [[gas monster]] in order to get the [[key]] to the box. This monster is only able to be defeated by throwing back its own fireballs with a [[Wannies Glove]]. After Twinsen kills the monster, he has the key to the box, and is thus able to get the fragment.
