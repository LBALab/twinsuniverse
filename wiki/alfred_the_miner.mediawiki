==Description==
Alfred is a rather heavy [[wannie]], working as a miner in the [[mines]] of the [[Wannies Island]]. Like most of the workers at the place, he seems to be concerned with nothing but mining all day. However, once a person dares touch their precious [[Wannies Fragment|fragment]], and he will deal with them.

==Role in Twinsen's Adventure==
Once stealing the Wannies' fragment, [[Twinsen]] had to face three angry wannies running into the room. After beating them, he was able to get out of the room, where he encountered Alfred. Being mad at the thief [[quetch]], Alfred attacked Twinsen, trying to beat him. Using his smarts and powers, Twinsen was eventually able to defeat the wannie, and get out of the mines.
