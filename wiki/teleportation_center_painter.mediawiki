==Description==
The '''Teleportation Center painter''', whose name is unknown, was in charge of doing some left painting work for [[FunFrock]]'s [[Teleportation Center]]. His main task was to paint over the symbol of [[Sendell]] that kept reappearing on the wall.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
After [[Mies van der Rooh]] had hinted on the weak point of the Teleportation Center on the left side of the building, the Teleportation Center painter gave [[Twinsen]] the final hint to his way of entrance to the well protected building. Twinsen had to blow the [[Horn of Gawley]] in front of the Sendell symbol on the wall in order to get inside the building.
