The **Holomap** is a 3-Dimensional map that shows
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s exact position. While in [Little Big
Adventure 1](Little_Big_Adventure_1 "wikilink") it can only show the
entire island, [Little Big Adventure
2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink") also has the option of zooming in
to the island Twinsen is currently visiting. The holomap also shows
arrows pointing to places Twinsen needs to go to in order to complete
tasks in the game.

While the holomap is not a necessarry item needed to complete either of
the games, it can come in handy for players in order to know their
whereabouts, or remember where they need to go. In LBA 1, Twinsen finds
a holomap in a locker in the [citadel](citadel "wikilink"), together
with [his ID card](Twinsen's_ID_card "wikilink"). If he doesn't take it
from there, he can also buy one in the
[bazaar](Old_Burg_bazaar "wikilink") at the [Old
Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink") in [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"). In LBA 2 he finds the holomap in a
locked room in [his house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink"). It is available
for sale on several shops as well.
