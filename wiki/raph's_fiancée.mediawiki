'''Raph's fiancé''' is a nameless [[rabbibunny]], who is engaged to [[Raph]], the [[lighthouse]] keeper.

During his search for Raph, [[Twinsen]] meets his fiancé, who tells him she is worried about Raph. She gives him a small hint, saying Raph might be found in the [[cliffs]].

After Twinsen frees Raph from the [[Tralu]], his fiancé thanks him for that. She is later seen together with Raph on top of the lighthouse.
