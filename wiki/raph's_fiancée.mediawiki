'''Raph's Fiancée''' is a nameless [[rabbibunny]], who is engaged to [[Raph]], the [[lighthouse]] keeper. She is found near the lighthouse on [[Citadel Island]], with an umbrella during the [[storm]].

During his search for Raph, [[Twinsen]] meets his fiancée, who tells him she is worried about Raph's disappearance. She gives him a small hint, saying Raph might be found near the [[cliffs]].

After Twinsen frees Raph from the [[Tralu]], his fiancée thanks him for it. She is later seen together with Raph on top of the lighthouse.
