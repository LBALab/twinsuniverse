Welcome!


This is the new edition of the Encyclopedia Twinsunica ([http://www.cs.vu.nl/~bkarel/lba/ old version]), this time powered by [http://www.mediawiki.org MediaWiki] for tremendous flexibility. It's better on nearly all points than my own script.


There's a lot of work to be done, mainly copy/pasting existing current articles into this new engine for now. But feel free to fine-tune existing articles as well! The powerful MediaWiki engine allows for a lot of people to work simultaneously, you can do whatever you want whenever you want, without the help of administrators. First of all, it's convenient if you'd sign up / log in: [[Special:Userlogin]]


Please consult the [[Index]] to check out what's still to be written.<br>
And check out the [[Special:Imagelist]] for a list of images you can insert into articles.


The layout is still the default one. I will make a custom one to accomodate the LBA/Twinsunica feeling more ;-)


Read the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents MediaWiki Users Guide] for help about this system. It's fairly easy, but you should get accustomed to using the layout tags in the editing field. You can always take a sneak peak in any [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] page to see how they did certain things.


Try to work clean!
