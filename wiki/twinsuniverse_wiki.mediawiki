<!-- This is a responsive front page design that adapts to the available width 
     of the browser by showing content in 1, 2, or 3 columns.

     This is done by dividing the main content of the page into four numbered sections.
     When the window is narrow, as on low-res displays, the content is displayed in a
     single column in order: 1, 2, 3, 4

     When the window is medium, as on medium-res displays, there are two columns.
     Section 1 and 2 are on top with 1 on the left and 2 on the right. 
     Sections 3 and 4 are on the bottom with 4 at the left and 3 at the right.

     When the window is wide, as on high-res displays, there are three columns.
     Sections 1 and 4 take up the left column, with section 1 on top.
     Section 2 takes up the middle column.
     Section 3 takes up the right column.

     Or, visually...
