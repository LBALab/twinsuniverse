Welcome to the '''[[Twinsuniverse_Wiki Wiki:About|Twinsuniverse_Wiki Wiki]]'''. This is the product of what once started as the LBA compendium project in December 2000. The goal of this project is to make a complete knowledge base of the worlds of the adventure games [[wikipedia:Little Big Adventure|Little Big Adventure]] (Relentless) and [[wikipedia:Little Big Adventure 2|Little Big Adventure 2]] (Twinsen's Oddysey).

The Twinsuniverse_Wiki Wiki currently contains '''[[Twinsuniverse_Wiki Wiki:Statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]]''' articles.

'''WARNING''': This is a complete knowledge base, meaning it contains both official as well as non-official information. This knowledge base is full with spoilers!! So it's recommended not to read any further without having both games played. Otherwise, spoilers at your own risk.
