==Description==
'''John Edgar H.''' is an agent working for the Sup Bureau of Investigation of [[Zeelich]]. He was a spy on [[Twinsun]] during the [[Esmer]] invasion of the planet, often hiding in trash bins and fake cacti.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
John's mission on Twinsun was to kill [[Twinsen]]. Twinsen encountered him some times when travelling around [[Desert Island]], when he was shooting from a thrash bin or a cactus.

Twinsen eventually sneaked into an [[esmer shuttle]], and saw John receiving orders from the SBI.
