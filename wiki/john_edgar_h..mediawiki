'''John Edgar H.''' is an agent working for the Sup Bureau of Investigation of [[Zeelich]]. He was a spy on [[Twinsun]] during the [[Esmer]] invasion of the planet, often hiding in trash bins and fake cacti.

John's mission on Twinsun is to kill [[Twinsen]]. Twinsen encounters him some times when travelling around [[Desert Island]], when he is shooting from a rubbish bin or a cactus.

Twinsen eventually sneaks into an [[esmer shuttle]], and notices John receiving orders from the SBI.
