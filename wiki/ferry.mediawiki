==Description==
The '''ferry''' is a service between [[Citadel Island]], [[Principal Island]] and later the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]]. Passengers have to buy a [[ferry ticket]] to board.

By the time of Twinsen's second adventure, the old, white ferry had been replaced with a new yellow one resembling a hovercraft. During the time of the [[Esmer invasion]], the ferry services were not allowed.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==

[[Twinsen]] had to use the ferry several times during his adventure. He needed it to get to [[Principal Island]]. As the [[rabbibunny]] at the ferry ticket store did recognize him as the wanted refugee, however, he had to buy fake ferry tickets from a [[grobo]]. He first had to help the grobo moving around crates in the nearby [[warehouse]]. He later bought his [[catamaran]], enabling to move around freely on [[Twinsun]]'s [[Southern Hemisphere]] without having to use the ferry service.

During his second adventure, he used it to get to the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]] while his [[Dino-Fly]] was injured. When he healed him with the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]], he was allowed to freely move around on Twinsun again.
