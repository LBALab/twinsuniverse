It was also used to destroy [[Twinsen's house]]. There are also tanks guarding [[FunFrock's fortress|FunFrock's fortresses]], or the [[Okojo Pass]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. They could also be seen on [[Desert Island]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
During the rebel assault on the [[Okojo Pass]], [[Twinsen]] and a rebel rabbibunny stole a tank in order to get access to the small fort guarding the pass. However, the tank was not controlled by Twinsen, but by the rebel rabbibunny instead.
