'''Joe the Elf''' is a green [[Elf]]. He has magical powers to teleport himself, and is able to use [[telepod]]s, which are supposed to work only for [[clone]]s. He is a member of the Elves Club and a friend of [[Twinsen]].

==During FunFrock's Reign==
Twinsen finds Joe in a grotto in the [[White Leaf Desert]] in [[Little Big Adventure 1]]. Joe is trapped in a labyrinth, allegedly because he wasn't supposed to be in the game. After Twinsen opens the entrance of the cave with the [[Horn of Gawley]], however, he is able to leave it. Joe makes Twinsen an honorary Elf as a reward, by giving him the [[Elves Club Blue Card]]. With this card, Twinsen is able to open a locked door in a small fortress in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

Joe later goes out to explore the world. According to the [[horse]] galloping in the desert, he is looking for a captured princess to be rescued.

If Twinsen uses his [[Flask of Clear Water]] in the [[Water Tower]] to clear the water supply of [[Principal Island]], Joe teleports in from the telepod on top of the Water Tower, claiming that teleportation makes him nauseous.

==During Twinsen's Odyssey==
Twinsen and Joe meet again several times in [[Little Big Adventure 2]]. Firstly, in the [[Tral√º's cave]], where Joe shows his magical teleporting power, which are not yet working all right.

They meet again in the [[Cemetery]] in front of the [[School of Magic]]. Joe is transformed into a shell for unknown reasons. However, Twinsen is able to heal him with the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]]. Joe gives him three [[Clover Leaf|Clover leaves]] as a reward.

Later on, Joe goes to [[Zeelich]] along with [[Twinsun]]'s wizards. As the wizards are captured by the forces of the [[Emperor]], he is scared and plans to get back to [[Twinsun]]. On his way, he meets Twinsen, in his [[Wizard's Parade Tunic]], at the [[Otringal]] [[astroport]]. He recognizes Twinsen and calls him by his name. The [[Esmer]]s, who don't yet recognize Twinsen, thus put both of them in the [[Otringal prison]].

In prison, Joe teleports himself into Twinsen's cell. He tells Twinsen about the Esmers' plans to abduct the children of Twinsun. He also attracts a [[Franco Police Officer]], who opens the cell's door, making it possible for Twinsen to escape the prison. Joe himself hides in the [[Esmer shuttle]] that Twinsen steals, and appears later in the crashed shuttle on the [[Ridge of the Flowers Circle]]. He claims he would like to get back to Zeelich, as the wizards are left alone there now.
