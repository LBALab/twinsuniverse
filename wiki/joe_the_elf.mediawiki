Character=Joe the Elf}}

== Description ==
'''Joe the Elf''' is a green [[Elf]]. He has magic powers to teleport himself, and is able to use [[telepod]]s, which where supposed to only work for [[Clones]]. He is a member of the Elves Club and a friend of [[Twinsen]].

== Role in Twinsen's adventures ==
Twinsen found Joe in a grotto in the [[White Leaf Desert]] during his first adventure. He was trapped in a maze. After Twinsen had opened the entrance of the cave with the [[Horn of Gawley]], however, he was able to leave it. He made Twinsen a honorary Elf as a reward, by giving him the [[Elves Club Blue Card]]. With this card, Twinsen was able to open a locked door in a small fortress in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

Meanwhile, Joe went out to explore the world. According to a [[horse]], he was looking for a captured princess to be rescued.

Twinsen and Joe met again several times during Twinsen's second adventure. Firstly, in the [[Tral√º's cave]], where Joe showed his magical teleporting power, which were not yet working all right.

They met again in the [[Cemetery]] in front of the [[School of Magic]]. Joe was transformed into a shell for unknown reasons. However, Twinsen was able to heal him with the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]]. Joe gave him [[Clover leaf|Clover leaves]] as a reward.

Later on, Joe went to [[Zeelich]] along with Twinsun's wizards. As the wizards were captured by the forces of the [[Emperor]], he was scared and planned to get back to [[Twinsun]]. On his way, he met Twinsen, in his [[wizard's parade tunic]], at the [[Otringal]] [[astroport]]. He recognized Twinsen and called him by his name. The [[Esmers]], who had not yet recognized Twinsen, thus put both of then in the [[Otringal prison]].

In prison, Joe teleported himself into Twinsen's cell. He told Twinsen about the Esmers' plans to abduct the children of Twinsen. He also attracted a [[Franco policeman]], who opened the cell's door, making it possible for Twinsen to escape the prison. Joe himself hid in the [[Esmer shuttle]] that Twinsen stole.

==Trivia==
After Twinsen had used his [[Flask of Clear Water]] in the [[Water Tower]] to clear the water supply of [[Principal Island]], Joe teleported in from the telepod on top of the Water Tower. The teleportation had made him nauseous. It is unknown how he was able to use the telepod, as there are none seen on [[Desert Island]].

When Twinsen had a close look on the shuttle wreck at the [[Ridge of the Flowers Circle]], Joe eventually came out of it, telling he had hid in the shuttle when Twinsen left from Zeelich. However, we would have liked it to get back to Zeelich, as the wizards were left alone there now.
