**Fish-Bulls** are dog-like creatures from
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). They bite everything that moves.
Fish-Bulls can be seen black or brown. Some are well behaved and wear
muzzles while standing near their owner, while others are violent and
will attack [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") as soon as he gets too close.

These creatures are used as fighting dogs by the
[Emperor](Emperor "wikilink")'s forces. There is a [training
course](training_course "wikilink") for them in the [lower
city](lower_city "wikilink") of [Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"). They
can also be found inside the [Emperor's
Palace](Emperor's_Palace "wikilink"), in the [Gazogem
Refinery](Gazogem_Refinery "wikilink") and in the [Wannie
Mines](Wannie_Mines "wikilink"). They are also brought to
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") by the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink"), where
they sometimes can be seen with muzzles. However, they go freely around
in the [White Leaf Desert](White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"), and during the
[Esmer invasion](Esmer_invasion "wikilink") at several places on
[Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink") and inside the Turkish bath
of the [Hacienda del
Monte-Pelado](Hacienda_del_Monte-Pelado "wikilink").

Twinsen has to get past these dogs several times during [Twinsen's
Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink"), for example at the entrance of
the [Temple of Bù](Temple_of_Bù "wikilink") when it is taken over by the
[Esmers](Esmer "wikilink"). However, the Fish-Bulls are not a big threat
to him.

When stepping into a Fish-Bull's crap in the Gaozgem Refinery, Twinsen
is able to find a [clover leaf](clover_leaf "wikilink").
