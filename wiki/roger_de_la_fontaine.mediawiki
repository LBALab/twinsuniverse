'''Roger de la Fontaine''' was the Burgmaster of the [[Island of the Francos]], who was in charge of looking after the [[Francos Key Fragment]]. He often buried the fragment to keep it safe, so that nobody could find it and steal it. One of his favourite pastimes was to spend time near the Gas, and that is where he met his death - eaten by a [[gas monster]]. Because nobody knew where he hid the fragment, the entire Island was whipped up into a frenzy, and everybody started looking for the fragment.

When searching for the lost fragment himself, [[Twinsen]] finds the [[burgermaster's key]], with which he opens a cupboard in [[Roger de la Fontaine's house]]. In this cupboard he finds the [[burgermaster's notes]], which provide clues about finding the fragment.

Roger de la Fontaine means "Roger of the Fountain" in French.
