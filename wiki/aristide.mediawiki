==Description==
Aristide is a [[grobo]] studying at the [[School of Magic]]. He is a rather bad pupil, unable to complete any of the tests.

==Role in Twinsen's Adventure==
Aristide had no role in Twinsen's adventure. At the most to laugh at, because he wasn't able to do the things [[Twinsen]] and the other wizards were able to.
