'''Aristide''' is a [[grobo]] studying at the [[School of Magic]]. He is either looking at the bulletin board or sitting on the bench in the lobby. He is a rather bad pupil, unable to complete any of the tests, as revealed by his complaining about not even being able to pass the [[Blowgun Test]]. He wonders whether or not he should even continue trying to become a wizard.

Twinsen meets him several times at the school's entrance. He hasn't shown any sign of posessing magical powers.
