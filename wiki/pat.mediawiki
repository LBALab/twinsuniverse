'''Pat''' is a [[quetch]] working as a musician. She is best friends with [[Fab]] and [[Raph]], who together formed a band. They all like hanging out at [[Chez Luc]].

Pat does not have a vital role in the game. [[Twinsen]] can ask her about Raph the [[lighthouse]] keeper, but he doesn't get much of an answer. If Twinsen puts some music on in the jukebox in the pub, Pat comes down and starts dancing next to it.
