'''Anatole''' is an old [[sphero]]. He often has pain in his back, which is treated by the healing wizard [[Ker'aooc]]. In his spare time, he likes to play pétanque with his [[Carlo (Port-Ludo)|friend Carlo]] at the pétanque pitch in [[Port-Ludo]] in [[Desert Island]]. Anatole keeps losing the game due to his hurt back.

Anatole gives [[Twinsen]] some hints, for example about the [[School of Magic]] or the wizards. Using the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]], Twinsen is able to heal Anatole, thus letting him win all his bowling games against Carlo, which upsets Carlo.
