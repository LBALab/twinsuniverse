Character=Anatole}}

==Description==
Anatole, being an older [[sphero]], often has pain in his back. When having one, he lets the healing wizard, [[Ker'aooc]], treating him. In his spare time, he likes to play bowling with his friend [[Carlo (bowler)|Carlo]] at the bowling pitch in [[Port-Ludo]]. He lives, just like Carlo, on [[Desert Island]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Like most characters on Desert Island, Anatole's only role was giving [[Twinsen]] some hints, for example about the [[school of magic]] or the wizards.

==Trivia==
Using the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]], Twinsen was able to heal Anatole, thus letting him win all his bowling games against Carlo.
