'''Anatole''' is an old [[sphero]]. He often has pain in his back, which is treated by the healing wizard, [[Ker'aooc]]. In his spare time, he likes to play bowling with his friend [[Carlo (bowler)|Carlo]] at the bowling pitch in [[Port-Ludo]] in [[Desert Island]]

Anatole gives [[Twinsen]] some hints, for example about the [[school of magic]] or the wizards. Using the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]], Twinsen is able to heal Anatole, thus letting him win all his bowling games against Carlo.
