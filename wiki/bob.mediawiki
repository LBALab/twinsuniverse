<center>''This article is about the grobo. For the astronomer sphero, see [[Bob Vortix]].''</center>

'''Bob''' is a [[grobo]] living on [[Citadel Island]]. Throughout most of [[Twinsen's Odyssey]] he is seen patrolling the western part of [[Lupin-Burg]], for no apparent reason. He is quite grumpy and complains a lot. Bob has a little grobo brother, studying at the [[schoolhouse]] of Citadel Island.

While it's raining, Bob complains to [[Twinsen]] about the weather and how he doesn't understand why the [[Weather Wizard]] isn't doing anything about it.

Bob also hints that [[Raph]] might have been kidnapped by [[The Tralü]].
After having defeated The Tralü, while Twinsen is walking with [[Zoé]], Bob asks them about the expectant baby that Zoé will soon be having.

When the [[Esmer]]s land on [[Twinsun]], Bob isn't too thrilled about their unexpected arrival.
