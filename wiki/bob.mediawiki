<center>''This article is about the grobo. For the astronomer sphero, see [[Bob Vortix]].''</center>

'''Bob''' is a [[grobo]] living in [[Citadel Island]]. Throughout most of LBA 2 he is seen patrolling the western part of [[Lupin-Burg]], for no visible reason. He is quite grumpy, and complains a lot. Bob has a little brother, studying at the [[school]] of Citadel Island.

Bob hints that [[Raph]] might have been kidnapped by the [[Tral√º]].
