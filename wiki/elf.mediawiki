An '''Elf''' is a magical creature that exists on [[Twinsun]].

Elves are known to be able to teleport, although allegedly this causes them nausea. During the reign of [[Dr. FunFrock]], elves don't officially exist.

Elves seem to have a a club, and would give an [[Elves Club Blue Card]] to anyone they consider their ally. When [[Twinsen]] receives such a card, the [[narrator]] says that he is now the fourth member of the club. The identity of the third member is never revealed in the game.

The two elves known in [[Little Big Adventure]] are [[Joe the Elf]] and [[Raymond the Elf]].
