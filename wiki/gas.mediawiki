:''This article is about the gas used for travels. For the Zeelichian layers, see [[Surface]] and [[Undergas]]''.

'''Gas''' on [[Twinsun]] is used for running vehicles. This substance is made of molasses, a thick and dark syrup produced during the refining of sugar. One can of gas is needed for each trip in a [[buggy]] or in a [[hydroglider]]. Gas cans are available for sale in several shops around the planet, always in packs of 10 cans. There are also a few for free in some places, like the [[water tower]] or the [[rebel camp]].

[[Twinsen]] needs the gas cans to reach several places too far to walk, such as the water tower and [[Port Belooga]] in [[Principal Island]], or the rebel camp in [[Rebellion Island]]. The gas is also used to run the hydroglider in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], before finding [[Dino-Fly]].
