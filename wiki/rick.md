**Rick** is a [sup](sup "wikilink") owning [Rick's
Café](Rick's_Café "wikilink") at the
[harbour](Otringal_harbour "wikilink") of
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"). He is also the head of the underworld
in Otringal. He is almost impossible to be granted an audience with.
Rick is considerably larger than any other sup met.

When searching for a way to access [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") talks with a [franco](franco "wikilink")
on the [Island of the
Celebration](Island_of_the_Celebration "wikilink"), the [Island CX
Survivor](Island_CX_Survivor "wikilink"), who tells him that the only
ones who might be able to help him are Rick and his gang. Twinsen then
goes to Rick's Café, where he finds out that Rick's office is well
guarded by heavily sized [wannies](wannie "wikilink"). Twinsen has two
ways to enter Rick's office: either by killing his body guards until one
of them leaves behind the [key](key "wikilink") to the office, or by
going through the backstage of the café and through a ventilation shaft.

In his office, Twinsen tells Rick about [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink")
being endangerd by the plans of the [Emperor](Emperor "wikilink"). Rick
reveals that he is unable to help Twinsen, and sends him to talk with
[Johnny Rocket](Johnny_Rocket "wikilink") at the [Imperial
Hotel](Imperial_Hotel "wikilink"), who is the head of the rebelling
[dissidents](dissidents "wikilink").
