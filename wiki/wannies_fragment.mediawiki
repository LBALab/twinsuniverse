==Description==
The '''Wannies Fragment''' was one of the four fragments which together summoned [[Dark Monk's Statue]] to complete the ceremony. This turned [[Zeelich]] back in its original look after 10,000 ceremonies. The Wannies Fragment is the green "above" piece of [[Dark Monk's Key]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
As a part of his quest of uniting the four key fragments, [[Twinsen]] had to find the Wannies Fragment. It was located in a room in the [[Wannies Mine]]s, protected by the [[Wannie Chapel Guard|a huge guard]]. After killing the guard, Twinsen retrieved the key to the room. In there, it turned out that the room looked like [[Dark Monk's Chapel]], but then with a fragment. After taking the fragment, Twinsen had to fight his way out, as the [[Wannie]]s in the mine wanted their fragment back.

==Unconfirmed theories==
After picking up the Wannies Fragment, Twinsen heard a voice speaking to him. It might have been the real [[Dark Monk]], who was making sure the whole [[prophecy]] would be fullfilled.
