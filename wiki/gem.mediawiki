==Description==
'''Gems''' can be found in the [[Gems Mine]] in the [[Wannies Island]]. The [[Wannies]] mine them, and the [[Francos]] extract them into the [[Zeelich|Zeelichian]] fuel, called [[gazogem]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In order to reach [[Island CX]], Twinsen first had to go to the [[Island of the Mosquibees]]. His only way to do this was by calling the [[ferryman]], who is the only link between the islands of the [[under-gas]]. The ferryman charged Twinsen four gems every time he took him somewhere.

Quote=Franco representative. The Francos live on the island of the Francos, (what a surprise!), which is enshrouded by the gas swarming with monsters. The Francos refine the gems extracted in the under-gas, and turn them into gazogem, usable by all the vehicles of Zeelich.|
