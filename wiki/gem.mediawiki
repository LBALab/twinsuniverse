'''Gems''' are found in the [[Gems Mine]] in the [[Island of the Wannies]]. The [[Wannies]] mine them, and the [[Francos]] extract them into the [[Zeelich]]ian fuel, [[gazogem]].

[[Twinsen]], however, uses the gems for something else; needing to travel between the islands of the [[Undergas]], he calls the services of the [[Ferryman]], who charges passengers four gems a trip. Twinsen collects the gems in the Wannies mines, where there is a total of 8 gems. There are also 4 gems in the [[Island of the Mosquibees]], and 4 in the [[Volcano Island]].
