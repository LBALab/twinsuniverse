==Description==
The '''francos' fragment''' is one of the four fragments which together summon [[Dark Monk's statue]] to complete the ceremony. This will turn [[Zeelich]] back in its original look after 10,000 ceremonies. The Francos Fragment is the red right piece of [[Dark Monk's key]].

The fragment itself was lost years before [[Twinsen]]'s second adventure, as the franco who hid it, [[Roger de la Fontaine]], was eaten by a gas monster. Due to that, most of the island's inhabitants spent most of their spare time searching for it.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
As part of his quest to unite the four key fragments into Dark Monk's key, Twinsen had to find the Francos Fragment. Unfortunately, Roger de la Fontaine, the only one person who knew where it was, was eaten by a monster from the gas. Thanks to a couple of tips, Twinsen managed to find the [[burgermaster's key]], which he used to get the [[burgermaster's notes]]. Following the instructions on the notes, Twinsen reached a place behind the [[Francos Island bazaar|bazaar]]. Once digging there by using his [[pick-ax]], the fragment was at his possession.
