==Description==
Kurtz lives on the [[Village of the Francos]], in a house where he made sure no sunlight could come in. His flowers are the proof.
Like most of the island's inhabitants, Kurtz is also in a treasure hunt after the lost [[Francos fragment|fragment]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Like most villagers at the [[Francos Island]], Kurtz had no specific role in [[Twinsen]]'s adventure. He was just there, searching for the fragment, like almost all other inhabitants of the place.

Quote=Taking the size of the island, its geological structure and wind direction into account. I have concocted a potion which should allow me to precisely determine the location of the fragment! Unfortunately...I uh, lost the vial.|
