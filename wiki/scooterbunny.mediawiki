==Description==

A rabbibunny who taxi's citizens around [[Citadel Island]] for a small fare.

He is found in a garage during the rain complaining about the storm. After the rain stops, he drives around the town square. If [[Twinsen]] stops him, he will offer to give him a ride up to the [[Ridge of the Flowers Circle‏‎|Flower Circle]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In LBA2 the scooterbunny can take you for a ride to the furthest points of Citidel Island ([[Weather Wizard tent]] and [[Lighthouse]]) aswell as [[Lupin-Burg]] City for only 8 kashes. He only drives his scooter when it is sunny.
When it is raining on Citidel Island he provides you with a hint that you can jump while you're running to go further.

 |I don't take anyone in the storm, I hate this weather. And why doesn't the Weather Wizard intervene, heh? By the way, did you notice that you could jump while you are running?
