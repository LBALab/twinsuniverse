==Description==

A rabbibunny who taxi's citizens around [[Citadel Island]] for a small fare.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In LBA2 the scooterbunny can take you for a ride to the furthest points of Citidel Island ([[Weather Wizard tent]] and [[Lighthouse]]) aswell as [[Lupin-Burg]] City for only 8 kashes. He only drives his scooter when it is sunny.
When it is raining on Citidel Island he provides you with a hint that you can jump while you're running to go further.
