## Description

Zed is a grobo living on [Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").
His only hobby seems to be collecting mushrooms, something he likes
doing while it rains. He also likes to lay at the beach during sunnier
weather.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Zed had no real role during [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s adventures.
He only gave Twinsen some hints, like most characters. In his case:
Twinsen can drown, where to seek [Raph](Raph "wikilink") and that
mushrooms could come in handy.
