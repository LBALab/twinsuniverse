==Description==

'''The Tralü''' is a monster who lives in the [[caves]] up in the [[cliffs]] of [[Citadel Island]], and who no one was sure actually existed, until it was killed by [[Twinsen]] when he was freeing [[Raph]] the [[Lighthouse]] keeper.

The Tralü has two mini-Tralüs, possibly offspring, who Twinsen encounters in the caves first. Unlike the smaller ones, the bigger Tralü has two attacks, one being the green darts that it shoots from it's mouth and the second being it's spin attack. The two smaller ones only have the dart attack.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

When Twinsen discovers Raph captured by the Tralü, about to be turned into his dinner, Twinsen goes through several parts of the cave to reach and kill the Tralü, and free Raph, so the [[Weather Wizard]] can use his [[Lighthouse]] for a [[Ring of Lightning|spell]].
