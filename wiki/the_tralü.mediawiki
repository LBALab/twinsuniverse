==Description==

'''The Tralü''' is a monster who lives in the [[caves]] up in the [[cliffs]] of [[Citadel Island]], and who no one was sure actually existed, until it was killed by [[Twinsen]] when he was freeing [[Raph]] the [[Lighthouse]] keeper.
The Tralu has two mini-tralus, possibly offspring, who Twinsen encounters in the cave first.

The Tralü has two attacks, one being the green darts that it shoots from it's mouth and the second being it's spin attack. There are three Tralüs guarding the caves. The two smaller ones and the big boss.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

When Twinsen discovers Raph captured by the Tralu, about to be turned into his dinner, Twinsen goes through several parts of the cave to reach and kill the Tralu, and free Raph, so the [[Weather Wizard]] can use his Lighthouse for a [[Ring of Lightning|spell]].
