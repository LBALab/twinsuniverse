==Description==
As [[Jerome Baldino]] explained to [[Twinsen]] when they first met, the '''Proto-Pack''' is a small reactor that goes upon one's back, and practically enables the person flying a few inches above the ground. As this is really a one-of-a-kind device, it is considered extremely powerful, and the owner of which can truly use it for his own advantage.

The process of making the proto-pack was kept secret by Baldino, and it is unknown how he built the device. All that is known, is that in order to fine tune to motor's power, a rehostat like the ones found in [[hairdryer|hairdryers]] is needed.

The Proto-Pack that was used in Twinsen's adventures is red coloured, with a dark-grey base. It is rather small, and suits perfectly to the back of an average [[quetch]]. No usage of other species was reported on the Proto-Pack, though.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
Looking for the desired treausre of [[LeBorgne]] during his first adventure, Twinsen has arrived to [[Proxima Island]], where he met, for the first time, the scientist [[grobo]] Jerome Baldino. Jerome has introduced himself to Twinsen as a creator of "miscellaneous Gadgets and inventions", and told the quetch about his latest invention: the Proto-Pack. After obtaining a hairdryer, on Baldino's request, Twinsen was awarded with the Proto-Pack, along with 10 [[kashes]] he receievd for testing it.

The main use Twinsen had for the Proto-Pack, was at the [[Maritime Museum]] of Proxima Island. Since the alarm of the museum was on, Twinsen must have used the Proto-Pack, as the slightest step on the floor would sound the alarm, and in to time two [[clones]] would come there to beat him. After flying his way to the treasure at the end of the museum, Twinsen was eventually able to steal the [[Key to the Heir's room|key]], and exit the museum before anyone noticed.

Another use for the Proto-Pack in the first adventure, was on [[Peg-Leg street]] at [[Principal Island]]. As [[Julia]] and [[Beatrice]] explained to him, Twinsen had to fly to the small island nearby the street, and thus get the [[clvoer box]] that was there.

Abother two useful places for the Proto-Pack were [[Desert Island]]'s mooring point, where Twinsen used it in order to get straight to the mainland and back (as opposed to jumping from rock to rock), and in [[Dino-Fly Street]] at [[Tippett Island]], trying to avoid the giant crab swimming in the water.

After the end of his first adventure, Twinsen gave the Proto-Pack back to Baldino, most likely because he thought he won't need it any more. Either way, Jerome has promised the quetch to fix and improve the Proto-Pack, and enable it to fly even higher.

However, it did take some time in Twinsen's second adventure until he managed to get the Proto-Pack. Only when he had to get the [[pearl of incandescence]] was he required to use this flying machine, as the spikes in the [[Cave of the Pearl of Incandescence|cave where the pearl was]] did not enable him reaching the pearl. But by that time, Baldino was already far away, on the [[Emerald Moon]].

Since he knew Twinsen would need the Proto-Pack sooner or later, Jerome Baldino has left it for the quetch in the [[Baggage Claim]] building at [[Lupin-Burg]]. Once there, Twinsen had to solve a couple of puzzles, that included directing a crates-mover and pushing the crate along the lane, before the grobo in charge of the Baggage Claim could open the box for him. Twinsen then had the desired Proto-Pack, and was able to get to the Pearl of Incandescence.

Two planets later, after they crashed on [[Zeelich]], Baldino has asked Twinsen to get him a [[can of gazogem]], so that he could upgrade the Proto-Pack into a [[Super-Jetpack]]. Even though he was displeased with the request (as he was in a hurry to reach [[Island CX]]), Twinsen was eventually required to get the gazogem from the [[Gazogem Refinery]], as he needed the Super-Jetpack in order to reach [[Otringal]]'s [[Upper City]], and meet [[Johnny Rocket]] there. Once getting Jerome the gazogem can, Twinsen immediately had the Super-Jetpack, that enabled him flying both higher and faster. Twinsen could still use the normal Proto-Pack, although it was no longer necessarry.

{{Quote|
Quote=I've been working on a Jet-Pack prototype for days now. It's a small reactor that harnesses onto your back and allows you to fly about. My problem is that my last test flight wreaked a bit of havoc on the garden wall. It is rather difficult to fine tune the motor's power. I need a rheostat like the one you find in a hair dryer. Do you think you can find one of those for me?|

{{Quote|
Quote=Well it's not a Jet-Pack yet, it's still just a Proto-Pack. I would appreciate it if you could test it out to see how it works. You should be able to fly over the water if you approach it from a gently sloping beach. But don't jump! Will you test it for 10 Kashes?|

Quote=How's the Proto-Pack coming along? Keep testing, I have a bunch of calculations to finish up. And be careful when approaching water: you can only fly by coming in from a gently sloping beach.|

Quote=No, Baldino left a little earlier for the emerald moon, where he'd noticed something was wrong. He left the proto-pack in working order downtown at the baggage claim, where you can pick it up.|
