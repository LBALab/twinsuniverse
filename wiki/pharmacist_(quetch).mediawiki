The '''pharmacist''' is a [[quetch]] running the [[Citadel Island]] [[pharmacy]] during the reign of [[FunFrock]].

It has been suspected by fans that he is the "informant" the [[nurse]] in the [[Citadel]] is talking about, and thus is maybe responsible for [[Twinsen]]'s arrest.

When Twinsen comes to the pharmacy to get a bottle of [[cherry syrup]], it is obvious that the pharmacist fears Twinsen, as he is very scared when he sees that Twinsen had managed to escape the Citadel. The pharmacist manages to call a [[grobo clone]] using his alarm button, but is eventually killed by Twinsen.
