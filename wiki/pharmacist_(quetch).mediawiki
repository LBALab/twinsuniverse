==Description==
The pharmacist ran the [[Citadel Island]] [[pharmacy]] for a period during the reign of [[Funfrock]]. He was probably the "informant" the nurse was talking about, and thus was maybe responsible for [[Twinsen]]'s arrest. He obviously feared Twinsen, as he was very scared when he saw that Twinsen had managed to escape. He was eventually killed by Twinsen.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The pharmacist had no paticular role, but is the main reason why Twinsen was in the [[Citadel]]. He Also tried to stop Twinsen from getting a bottle of [[cherry syrup]], within the pharmacy.
