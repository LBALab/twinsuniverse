The '''Orange Powder''' is a special powder that allows recharging [[magic points|magic]] and [[life points]] to full capacity. Only fully qualified wizards are able to buy this powder, and it is sold by Chedil Amiradoo, who also sells various wizards' accessories.

[[Twinsen]] didn't have to buy the powder, but it was quite useful when his life and magic points were going low. Also, the price is rather cheap.
