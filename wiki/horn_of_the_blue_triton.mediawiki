'''The Horn of the Blue Triton''' is a horn storing [[life candies]]. This horn enables the owner to store a higher amount of life candies, as well as use those candies to heal other people.

[[Twinsen]]'s very first object in [[Little Big Adventure 2]] is to find a way to cure [[Dino-Fly]]. During his studies at the [[School of Magic]], he has to undergo the [[Garden Balsam Flower]] test. As a reward for completing the test, Twinsen receives the Horn of the Blue Triton, which is half-empty when he receives it. Twinsen can fill the horn using life candies he finds around the planet, as well as with a [[clover leaf]]. With this horn, Twinsen can finally cure Dino-Fly, and thus complete the third test of the School of Magic- the [[Dome of the Slate]] test.

Twinsen can also use the horn to cure other people, though none of them are necessarry tasks in the game. He can use it on [[Joe the Elf]] at the [[cemetery]], after the elf accidentally turned himself into a shell. In return he receives 3 clover leaves. Additionally, Twinsen can use the horn to cure an injured [[Wannie]] in the [[Island of the Wannies]]. In return, the wannie gives Twinsen a [[gem]], and tells him about an easier access to the [[Astrid|Queen of the Mosquibees]]' cell.

The Horn also comes in handy when Twinsen wishes to renew a certain amount of life points. By using the horn, Twinsen can store these life points, and then extract them from the item whenever he needs to restore his health status.

It is also possible to use the horn for cheating in the [[Gloum Casino]] in [[Otringal]]. By dispensing a life candy on a course in the [[Duam]] race, the Duam who touches the candy is more likely to win the race.
