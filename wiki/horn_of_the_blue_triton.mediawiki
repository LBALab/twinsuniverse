==Description==
'''The Horn of the Blue Triton''' makes people healers. The Horn can store [[hearts]], used to heal people.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]]'s very first object of his second adventure was to find a way to treat [[Dino-Fly]]. During his studies at the [[School of Magic]], Twinsen had to undergo the [[Garden Balsam Flower]] test. As a reward for completing the test, Twinsen received the Horn of the Blue Triton. With this horn, Twinsen obtained the ability to heal Dino-Fly, as well as anyone else who needed some healing, including himself. Without it, the [[quetch]] would not be able to get to the [[Dome of the Slate]] and thus fail to complete the third test for the School of Magic.

The Horn also came in handy when Twinsen was required to renew a certain amount of life points. By using the Horn, Twinsen could store these life points, and then extract them from the item whenever he needed to restore his health status.

== Trivia ==
If the horn was empty while Twinsen was in the Gloum Casino, he could use it to make the rat-lizard creature in the center cage go to the hole near him.
