A '''Schmoutz''' is a yellow creature which looks like a fusion of a dog and a pig. These creatures are used as pets by [[Zeelich]]ians.

During his journey on Zeelich, Twinsen sees three of these creatures. One in the [[wannies' mines]], one in the [[wannies village]] and one in the [[Imperial hotel]]. They have no role in his adventure though.
