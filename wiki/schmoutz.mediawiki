These are very little yellow creatures which look like they are a fusion of dogs and pigs. They are used as pets.

==Role in Twinsen's advneutre==
Twinsen saw during his journey on [[Zeelich]] around 3 of these creatures. One in the [[wannies' mines]], one in the [[wannies village]] and one in the [[Imperial hotel]]. They didn't have any meaning for his adventure though.
