The '''Bonuses List''' is a small note listing some of the locations of [[clover box]] and clover leaves in [[Twinsun]]. The note is as follows:
{{Quote
 |Locations of several clover leaves and boxes: There is a box for clover leaves in the sewers of Citadel island, and another in the basement of the tavern; one clover leaf is guarded by a soldier who is located behind sandbags. Another is guarded by a clone in the middle of the ruins on Principal island. Another one is on the roof of the Maritime Museum. Another is guarded by a groboclone to the right of the Teleportation Center's entrance. Another is guarded by a soldier in front of FunFrock's fortress.
 |Inventory, Bonusses List
 |quoteid=435}}

This list is owned by [[Lanktir]], a [[grobo]] residing near the [[Proxima Island bazaar|bazaar]] in [[Proxim-City]].

By returning Lanktir the [[coffee pot]] on behalf of the [[sphero]] he meets near the [[Maritime Museum]], Twinsen receives this list as a reward. With it, Twinsen is able to know the locations of some clover boxes and clover leaves around the planet, thus being able to find them more easily.
