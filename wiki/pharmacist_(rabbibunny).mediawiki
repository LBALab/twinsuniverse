The '''pharmacist''' is a female [[rabbibunny]] running the [[pharmacy]] on [[Citadel Island]] in [[Little Big Adventure 2]]. She is the sister of [[Raph]], the [[lighthouse]] keeper.

After [[Dino-Fly]] is hit by a lightning during the [[storm]], [[Zoe]] sends [[Twinsen]] to the pharmacy to find a cure for him. The pharmacist tells Twinsen that she doesn't have anything for a Dino-Fly.

After the storm, in case Twinsen hasn't talked with [[Leone]], the pharmacist tells him that the healing wizard [[Ker'aooc]] might be able to help him.
