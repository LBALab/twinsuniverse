== Description ==
'''Red Sphero Clones''' are [[sphero]] [[clone]]s created by [[Dr. FunFrock]]. They are used as guards for his [[FunFrock's Secret Fortress|secret fortress]] and are also used on the secret [[Construction site|construction site]] between [[Fortress Island|Fortress]] and [[Polar Island]].

== Role in Twinsen's Adventure ==
[[Twinsen]] had to defeat a Red Sphero Clone guarding the entrance to the secret fortress in order to access it. He needed the clone's [[key]] to open the locked door.

On the Construction site, Twinsen ran into them on several occasions, but he never had to defeat one of them there. One Red Sphero Clone on the construction site was, however, holding a [[Clover leaf]].
