'''Lanktir''' is a [[grobo]] living in [[Proxim-City]] at [[Proxima Island]], next to the [[Proxim-City bazaar|bazaar]].

Lanktir gives [[Twinsen]] a [[keypad]] which he received by accident. Twinsen can use this keypad later to open a secret room in the [[Teleportation Center]]. Addtionally, if Twinsen follows the directions in [[LeBorgne]]'s log, a [[sphero]] comes and gives him a [[coffee pot]], asking him to return it to Lanktir. In return to the coffee pot, Lanktir gives Twinsen a [[bonuses list]], detailing the locations of some [[clover boxes]] and clover leaves around [[Twinsun]].
