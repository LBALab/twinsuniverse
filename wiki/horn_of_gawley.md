**Gawley's Horn** is an object left for [The
Heir](Legend_of_Sendell "wikilink") by his ancestors in a secret cave
behind his house. It enables breaking open the seals of
[Sendell](Sendell "wikilink"), thus leading to new places. To use the
horn, the person should blow it towards a Seal of Sendell.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") finds the Horn of Gawley, along with
[Sendell's Medallion](Sendell's_Medallion "wikilink"), in a locked room
in the cave behind [his house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink"), to which he
can enter after retrieving [LeBorgne's
key](Key_to_the_Heir's_room "wikilink") from the [Maritime
Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink"). He can use the horn right after
finding it, on a Sendell's Seal in the room, which reveals a [clover
leaf](clover_leaf "wikilink").

Even though behind most seals there are only bonuses like clover leaves,
some seals are necessary for Twinsen to go through. For example, he has
to use the horn on the Sendell's Seal in the [White Leaf
Desert](White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"), so that he can meet [Joe the
Elf](Joe_the_Elf "wikilink") and get the [Elves Club
card](Elves_Club_card "wikilink") from him. Another example is near one
of the [Runic Stones](Runic_Stones "wikilink") in [Proxima
Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink"), where Twinsen has to blow the horn
so that he can get to the stone.

Twinsen also needs the horn to break into the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink") on [Brundle
Island](Brundle_Island "wikilink") and to find the third runic stone in
[FunFrock's Secret Fortress](FunFrock's_Secret_Fortress "wikilink"). A
Sendell's Seal is also blocking the way down to [Sendell's
Well](Sendell's_Well "wikilink").

During [Twinsen's Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink") the Horn of
Gawley is an exhibit in [Miss Bloop's Private
Museum](Miss_Bloop's_Private_Museum "wikilink").
