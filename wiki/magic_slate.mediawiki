==Description==
The '''magic slate''' allows its possessor to store images of any kind, and in no time at all. These slates are rather rare, and are given only as rewards for completing a specific test in the [[School of Magic]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]] received the Magic Slate from the [[Mentor of the School of Magic]], after completing the [[Dome of the Slate]] test. With this Slate, Twinsen was able to store particular images that he found important enough to be recorded as he went about in his journey.

The Slate came in handy especially for storing maps. After making record of a map, Twinsen could then look at the Slate, and use it to examine various locations that are on it. Some examples of maps that ended up being stored into the Magic Slate are Dome of the Slate, [[Citadel Island sewers|Sewers of Citadel Island]] and the [[Emerald Moon base]].
