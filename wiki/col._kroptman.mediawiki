'''Kroptman''' is a firm [[sphero]] rebelling against [[FunFrock]] during his reign. He became the colonel of the [[rebels]] on [[Rebellion Island]]. Kroptman was captured during their assault on the [[Okojo pass]], which would lead them to the [[Northern hemisphere]] of [[Twinsun]].

When [[Twinsen]] arrives to Rebellion Island he is given the task to free the Colonel. A commando helps Twinsen to get into the fort which guards the pass and where Kroptman is being held. Freeing the Colonel eventually enables Twinsen to reach the Northern Hemisphere himself.

After Kroptman is freed by [[Twinsen]] he escapes together with the [[rabbibunny]] commando that had guided Twinsen to the fort. They both disappear.
