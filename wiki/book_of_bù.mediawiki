Quote=The day will come when someone from the present or future species will rise up and say, 'This world is mine from now on, and the key to all powers belongs to me!' This day will surely come because avarice and violence harbor in the hearts of all species of the universe. If the peril on this day is too great, the Chosen One will come forth. He will rise up against the tyrant and overthrow him. He will free and reunite the people, because throughout the years, the Chosen One's ancestors will have prepared him for his victory. They will have left information and weapons in his dwelling. The Chosen One, also known as the Heir, will, however, have to gather together four magical symbols if he hopes to be victorious: the Tunic, the Book of Bש, Sendell's Medallion and a Flask of Clear Water. On the day of peril Sendell will visit the Heir in his sleep and announce the coming of the final combat. The Heir will then have to go to the Well of Sendell where the goddess will endow her powers on him!|
Character=Book of Bù}}

==Description==
Down at the peaceful [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum|museum of Ms. Bloop]] in [[Lupin-Burg]], lies the '''Book of Bù'''. Although innocent-looking, a great history lies behind this book, which played a major role in [[Twinsen]]'s first adventure.

The book, as explained in its pages, is one of the four magical items that were needed to be collected by the Heir, for him to achieve victory. Furthermore, the owner of the book fastly becomes reach in knowledge, as the book enables its possessor to talk with the animals of [[Twinsn]], as well as to read the ancient language of Twinsun, Runic.

A further looking at this sacred book reveals even more interesting details. For example, it tells the exact [[prophecy of Sendell]], and describes clearly the events that post factum did happen at Twinsen's adventure. From this book, Twinsen learned his actual destiny: to overthrow the tyrant - Dr. [[FunFrock]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
When we review Twinsen's journey, we found out that retrieving the Book of Bù was not an original purpose for the [[Quetch]]. However, as soon as he did find it, his whole adventure took out a new, different route.

After reading a rare book at The [[library]]'s censored publications area, Twinsen made his steps to the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]]. There, he met the old hermit, a nameless [[rabbibunny]] who was most likely the smartest of his kind on the entire planet. That hermit told Twinsen that he knows about the so-called "Legend" that FunFrock really fears. He then sent the [[quetch]] to the [[Temple of Bù]], to fetch him the sacred Book of Bù. If he returns safely, our hero was guaranteed, he will then hear from the wise bunny all that he has to know about the Legend. After a long time of getting through all troubles and obstacles of the Temple, Twinsen finally made it to the last room. There, surrounded by old dead-yet-alive rabbibunnies skeletons, he found, spinning in air, the desired book. Twinsen could try killing the skeleton enemies, but a better idea came to his mind. Instead of trying to fight his opponents, the quetch ran straight to the holy book. Then, suddenly, a marvellous thing happened. The skeletons, apparently worshipping the book, stopped fighting Twinsen, and started all bowing to him.

After he got out of the temple, Twinsen passed the old book to the rabbibunny, who was still sitting outside, waiting for him. At this act, the hermit figured that Twinsen must be the Heir the prophecy speaks of, as only him could survive in this dangerous temple. Appreciating this, the old rabbi told Twinsen everything about the Legend, and sent him to [[Twinsen's house|his own house]] to continue his important quest.

Additionally, Twinsen was then able to speak with the animals of the planet, and also read Runic, two features that gave the brave quetch more power over his enemies. The book has also promoted his level of magic, from yellow to green.

==Unconfirmed theories==
The origin of the Book is unknown. It might be just like the Earthly bible, whose writer is unknwon, although the Twinsunian divinity is more tangible than the Earthly one. Another possibility is that the writer of the book was Bù himself, although absolutely nothing is known about him to nowadays Twinsunians.

==Trivia==
At the end of his first adventure, no longer needing the book, Twinsen contributed it to Ms. Bloop's private museum. There, visitors from all over the planet come and witness the items and objects that were vital at Twinsen's quest. However, Twinsen was still able to speak with the animals of Twinsen, even after giving the book away.

Quote= Very strange indeed. I'm just an old fool who would like to grow flowers in the desert, but... I know about this Legend that Dr. FunFrock forbade. I'll tell you what I know if you bring me a sacred book. It is in the Temple of Bù which was buried by a violent sand storm. You can still get in, however, through one of the ventilation shafts still visible just behind me. But be careful: there is danger everywhere!|

Quote= Only the Heir could have survived in that Temple! You are the Chosen One that the prophecy spoke of. You are worthy of keeping the Book of Bù, Twinsen. It will allow you to decipher the runes and to speak to the animals. The prophecy that must be accomplished is also revealed in its pages: you must overthrow Dr. FunFrock, the despot who has destroyed the harmony that once existed on this planet. In my dreams, I saw him profaning the Well of Sendell, which caused the immediate destruction of this world. You must go to the Well of Sendell to save us from Dr. FunFrock. I don't know where this well is, but your ancestors must have left instructions for you, somewhere in your home.|
