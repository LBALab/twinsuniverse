==Description==
'''Zlitos''' are the [[currency]] of [[Zeelich]], planet of the [[esmers]]. The esmers use them to buy anything they're interested in.

However, unlike the [[kashes]] in [[Twinsun]], it is much less likely to find Zlitos by searching rubbish bins and plants.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
With the Zlitos, [[Twinsen]] bought anything he was interested in on Zeelich.
