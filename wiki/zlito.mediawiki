==Description==
'''Zlitos''' are the currency of [[Zeelich]], planet of the [[esmer]]s. The esmers use them to buy anything they're interested in.

However, unlike the [[kash]]es on [[Twinsun]], it is much less likely to find Zlitos by searching rubbish bins and plants.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
With the Zlitos, [[Twinsen]] bought anything he was interested in on Zeelich.
