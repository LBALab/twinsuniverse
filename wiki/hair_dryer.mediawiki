The '''hair dryer''' in [[Little Big Adventure 1]] is a common hair dryer, used to dry one's hair by blowing hot air. A [[hair dryer salesman]] sells these hair dryers in several islands around the [[Southern Hemisphere]] of [[Twinsun]].

In a search for a way to walk around the [[Maritime Museum]] safely, [[Twinsen]] comes across [[Jerome Baldino's residence (Proxim-City)|Jerome Baldino's residence]], where he hears from [[Jerome Baldino]] about his plans of building a [[Proto-Pack]]. Baldino explains Twinsen that to complete the proto-pack, he needs a rheostat like the one found in hair dryer, and asks him to get one for him. Twinsen finds the hair dryer salesman patrolling around [[Proxima Island]], and buys a hair dryer from him for 30 [[kashes]]. He then gives the hair dryer to Baldino, who completes the proto-pack. Baldino also offers Twinsen 10 kashes to test the proto-pack.
