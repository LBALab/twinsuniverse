==Description==
'''Franco guards''' are omnipresent soldiers of the [[Emperor]]'s army on [[Zeelich]]. They can be seen with different weapons, from long pikes to big laser guns. They are seen at any place needing guarding, like the [[astroport]], the [[gazogem refinery]], and on many streets throughout the entire planet. Together with [[franco]] technicancs they build the crew of the [[Emerald Moon base]].

Along with the [[Esmer]] invasion on [[Twinsun]] they could be seen in the streets of [[Lupin-Burg]] and [[Port-Ludo]] and the [[secret esmer base]].

They are guarding the little harbour at the [[Island of the Celebration]], and are stationed on [[Island CX]].

The military troops of the Emperor attacking the [[village of the mosquibees]] was mainly consiting of franco guards and paratroopers.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Due to their omnipresence [[Twinsen]] often could not make a way around the franco guards. Particulary at the [[astroport]], the [[Island of the Wannies]], and [[Island CX]], he had to battle them, sometimes to get a [[key]].

With his rising strength, Twinsen could defeat them more easily, though they were still a treat by their number. For instance, the small streets of the [[Island of the Wannies]] were guarded by at least eight guards.

==Trivia==
When setting of an alarm in an airlock of the [[Emerald Moon base]], Twinsen was able to lure a guard into it. He quickly took on his space suit and opened the outer doors. Thus the franco guard, not wearing a space suit, was sucked out of the room into space.
