![[Joe the Elf](Joe_the_Elf "wikilink")](Joe_the_Elf.jpg "Joe the Elf")
An **Elf** is a magical creature that exists on
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink").

Elves are known to be able to teleport, although allegedly this causes
them nausea. During the reign of [Dr.
FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink"), elves don't officially exist.

Elves seem to have a a club, and would give an [Elves Club Blue
Card](Elves_Club_Blue_Card "wikilink") to anyone they consider their
ally. When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") receives such a card, the
[narrator](narrator "wikilink") says that he is now the fourth member of
the club. The identity of the third member is never revealed in the
game.

The two elves known in [Little Big
Adventure](Little_Big_Adventure "wikilink") are [Joe the
Elf](Joe_the_Elf "wikilink") and [Raymond the
Elf](Raymond_the_Elf "wikilink").
