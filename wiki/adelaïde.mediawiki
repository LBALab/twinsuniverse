Adela誰de is an ant-like tourist on [[Zeelich]] from the Red Planet. He likes the planet of Zeelich at first, believing that it has good law and order and clean streets and he highly respects the Esmers, but he soon changes his mind.

Adela誰de just walks around for his vacation on Zeelich. Very soon he realizes that the Zeelichians are worth less than they say, and warns [[Twinsen]] about the [[casino]].
