Quote=I shouldn't never have watched that commercial for Zeelich, it's so fake. The changing of the guard was lousy, we never even got to see the emperor, and that casino, it's a tourist clip-joint..."Have trust in our friendship..." Hah! Who are they trying to kidding!|

==Description==
Adelaïde is a tourist on [[Zeelich]] from an unknown planet. He looks a little like an ant.

==Role in Twinsen's Adventure==
Adelaïde just walked around for his vacation on Zeelich. Also he realized very soon that the Zeelichians are worth less than they say, and therefore could warn [[Twinsen]] about the [[casino]].
