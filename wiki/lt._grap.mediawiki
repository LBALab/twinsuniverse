Not accepting [[FunFrock]]'s tyrany, some rebel rabbibunnies have set up a camp on [[Rebellion Island]], planning to fight against him. The rebel's lieutenant is named Grap, a brave rabbibunny always willing to fight. Grap's buggy usually serves the rebels as a transportation method between the island's [[Rebellion Island harbour|harbour]] and the [[rebels' camp]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In the mission of freeing Colonal [[Kroptman]], Twinsen joined some of the rebelling rabbibunnies going to the [[Okojo Pass]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. However, Grap stayed in the island during this attack, and did not join the rebels.

Quote=So, young quetch, you've come to help in the fight against FunFrock? As you can see, this city has suffered because of our rebellion. We are constantly bombed, which is why our leaders have set their camp in the center of the island. You can take my buggy to go see them.|
