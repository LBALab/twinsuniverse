'''Money-Monkey''' is an assassin of an unknown race with four arms, who receives orders from [[FunFrock]] to track [[Twinsen]] down and kill him, as revealed by himself{{gamequote|1666}}. He sents his spies after Twinsen. As Twinsen may notice they are eavesdropping at a conversation between him and [[Johnny Rocket]] at the [[Imperial Hotel]], from which he figured out Twinsen would be coming to the [[Elevator Platform]] to the [[Undergas]], where he waited for him{{gamequote|1667}}.

His two attacks both will hit Twinsen very hard (8-10 lifepoints). He throws explosive wooden crates at him from a distance as well, causing extra damage.

When Twinsen has arrived to the elevator platform, he met the Money-Monkey for the first time. Entering the elevator requires a [[key]], so Twinsen had to kill the assassin first in order to retrieve the key and get in.
