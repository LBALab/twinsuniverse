'''Money-Monkey''' is an assassin of an unknown race with four arms.

Money-Monkey was sent by [[FunFrock]] to kill [[Twinsen]], as revealed by him:

Quote=I, my lad, am an assassin that Dark Monk's paid to eliminate you. But, looking at you, it seems I must have the wrong fellow. The lad I hunt is a warrior so fierce, that Dark Monk himself fears him!|

Money-Monkey sent spies to follow Twinsen after he visited [[Johnny Rocket]], and thus figured out Twinsen would be coming to the [[Elevator to the Undergas]], where he waited for him:

{{Quote|
Quote=Laddie, you are as savvy as a monster from the gas. When you established contact with Johnny Rocket, my spies were there. We have followed you since. I knew that you wanted to go down to the under-gas. Thus I waited here to strike. But enough said. Now, lad, prepare yourself to die!!|
Character=Money-Monkey}}

When Twinsen has arrived to the elevator platform, he met Money-Monkey there. Entering the elevator required a [[key]], so Twinsen has to kill the monkey first in order retrieve the key and get in. After killing Money-Monkey, Twinsen could enter the elevator, and reach the [[undergas]] of [[Zeelich]].
