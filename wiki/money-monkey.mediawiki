Quote=I, my lad, am an assassin that Dark Monk's paid to eliminate you. But, looking at you, it seems I must have the wrong fellow. The lad I hunt is a warrior so fierce, that Dark Monk himself fears him!|

Quote=Laddie, you are as savvy as a monster from the gas. When you established contact with Johnny Rocket, my spies were there. We have followed you since. I knew that you wanted to go down to the under-gas. Thus I waited here to strike. But enough said. Now, lad, prepare yourself to die!!|
