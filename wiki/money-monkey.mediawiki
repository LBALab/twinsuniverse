'''Money-Monkey''' is an assassin of an unknown race with four arms.

Money-Monkey was sent by [[FunFrock]] to kill [[Twinsen]], as revealed by himself ({{gamequote|1666}}). Money-Monkey sent spies to follow Twinsen after he visited [[Johnny Rocket]], and thus figured out Twinsen would be coming to the [[Elevator to the Undergas]], where he waited for him ({{gamequote|1667}}).

When Twinsen has arrived to the elevator platform, he met Money-Monkey there. Entering the elevator requires a [[key]], so Twinsen has to kill the monkey first in order retrieve the key and get in. After killing Money-Monkey, Twinsen could enter the elevator, and reach the [[undergas]] of [[Zeelich]].
