The '''Outside Citadel grobo''' is a [[grobo]] strolling around at the house of an old [[rabbibunny]], which is the closest to the [[Citadel]] in [[Citadel Island]]. He can be found in front of the house or near the great pile of garbage.

[[Twinsen]] meets this grobo while escaping from the Citadel. He hints him that it is possible to read posters, and later gives him a hint regarding where to find [[Zo√©]].
