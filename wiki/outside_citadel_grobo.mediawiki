==Description==
The '''Outside Citadel grobo''' is a [[grobo]] strolling around at the house of an old [[rabbibunny]], which is the closest to the [[Citadel]], in [[Lupin-Burg]]. He usually can be found in front of the house or near the great pile of garbage.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Apart from some hints about posters and where to find [[Zo√©]], he didn't play any special role in [[Twinsen]]'s adventure.
