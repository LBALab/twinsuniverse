'''Meca-Penguin''' is one of the weapons available in [[Little Big Adventure 1]]. Once winded up, these small penguins move slowly across the floor. Red [[clone]]s are attracted to these penguins, and when they see one, they leave their guard and go beating up the penguin. It can therefore be used as a distraction method against them.

Meca-Penguins are available in some shops around [[Twinsun]]. Additionally, [[rebels]] at [[Rebellion Island]] use them as practice targets. There is also one room in the [[Teleportation Center]] full of Meca-Penguins, which is accessible with a [[keypad]]. However, this room is not really effective, as it is only possible to possess one Meca-Penguin at a time.

Meca-Penguins never play a vital part in completing the game. However, they can come in handy when needing to get past red clones, for example in the entrance to [[FunFrock's headquarters]] in [[Principal Island]].

In [[Little Big Adventure 2]], the Meca-Penguins are replaced with [[Nitro-Meca-Penguin]]s, which explode instead of being beaten up.
