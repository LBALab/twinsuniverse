The '''baggage claim rabbibunny''' is a nameless [[rabbibunny]] employed at the [[Baggage Claim]] on [[Citadel Island]].

Twinsen meets the rabbibunny when he comes to the baggage claim building to retrieve his [[proto-pack]]. If Twinsen chooses to push the crate himself, he reaches the rabbibunny, who tells him grumpily to go away. Hitting the rabbibunny results in him running away to a conveyor belt that pushes him until he disappears in a hole in the wall.
