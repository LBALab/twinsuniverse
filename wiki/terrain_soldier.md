soldiers** are the basic soldiers in [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")'s
army. They can be seen with a yellow suit on the [Island of the White
Leaf Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"), with a white
suit in the [Hamalayi Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink"), and
with a green one everywhere else. They're omnipresent. They are
patrolling in nearly every public place, like [Lupin
Burg](Lupin_Burg "wikilink"), the [Old Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink") and
the rest of [Principal Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"), the
[Maritime Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink") on [Proxima
Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink"), in the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink") and at all fortresses and
factories of FunFrock. There's a [military
camp](military_camp "wikilink") on Principal and Desert Island.

The terrain soldiers are major enemies of [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink").
He encounters them at many different places in his adventure, and has to
fight them in various fortresses and factories, sometimes to get a
[key](key "wikilink"). However, they are easy to defeat most of the
time.

In [Peg Leg street](Peg_Leg_street "wikilink"), Twinsen encounters a
terrain soldier having a pee at nearby trees. While the soldier is
absent, Twinsen is able to steal his bike to get to the [water
tower](water_tower "wikilink").

In the [Old Burg](Old_Burg "wikilink"), there is a soldier standing in
front of a poster. When Twinsen pays 10 [kashes](kashes "wikilink"), he
is allowed to look at it:

The average soldier seems to be quite lazy. A few soldiers are seen
sleeping on the grass when on duty. Also, their level of intelligence
does not appear to be very high. When Twinsen emerges from the
[Principal Island prison](Principal_Island_prison "wikilink"), he is
stopped by a soldier, but is able to pass by saying he is Santa Claus.

Though the soldiers have human attributes, it is speculated that they
are in fact [Quetch](Quetch "wikilink") clones.
