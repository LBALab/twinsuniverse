'''Bob Vortix''' is a [[sphero]] astronomer living in the [[Old Burg]] on [[Principal Island]]. He was placed under house arrest because he knew too much about [[FunFrock]]'s tyranny. Due to his knowledge, he has gained respect from the citizens living on Principal Island.

During his house arrest, [[Bob Vortix's house|Bob's house]] is heavily guarded by several [[grobo clone]]s, who are probably afraid of people trying to reach him, thus gaining some of his knowledge.

In his search for information about [[Sendell's legend]], [[Twinsen]] reaches the Old Burg, where he hears from many citizens about the mass information the astronomer is able to give him. Following the citizens of the Old Burg, Twinsen eventually reaches Bob's house.

Inside the house, Twinsen hears from Bob that the legend can be a key in FunFrock's weakness. Bob suggests Twinsen to go to [[Port-Belooga]], and tell the [[fisherman]] that he (Bob) sent him. Bob also opens a chest in his house for Twinsen, containing a high sum of kashes.

When searching for information about [[LeBorgne]], Twinsen can come back to Bob's house. Bob then suggests him to go look in the local [[Principal Island bazaar|bazaar]] for information about the pirate.
