==Description==
The Captain is a nameless Franco whose job is to bring people to different islands for the price of 10 [[Zlitos]]. He calls his "boat" Leontine.

==Role in Twinsen's adventur==
Twinsen had to get to [[Island CX]], and the only one who seemed he could help Twinsen was the Captain. He asked 100 Zlitos for the trip to the person who can help Twinsen. After that, Twinsen could ask the Captain to bring him to one of the other islands, but hardly did so, since he asked for double the price of the other cabs.

Quote=Hmmm...Nobody wants to go there these days, it's way to risky. They say monsters have come out of the gas over there. Try the Captain, he's the old nut at the very end of the pier. He's the only one who'd take you!|
