The '''Captain''' is a nameless [[Franco]] who transports people around the islands of [[Zeelich's Surface]] for the price of 10 [[Zlitos]]. He calls his boat "Leontine".

When [[Twinsen]] crashes on [[Otringal]], his main objective is to find a way to reach [[Island CX]]. In the [[Otringal harbour|harbour]] he finds the captain, who in return for 100 zlitos tells Twinsen about a franco on [[Celebration Island]] who went to the island and came back alive. He then takes him to the island for free.

It's possible to use the captain's services afterwards, although he charges twice as much as the other captain in the harbour.
