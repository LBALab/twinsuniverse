==Description==
This race of crocodile-like creatures came to [[Zeelich]] once, settling mainly in [[Otringal]]. Absolutely all of the '''gloums''' on Otringal work at the [[casino]]. They are a bunch of aggresive frauds.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Owning a casino in the [[middle city]] of Otrinal, the gloums told [[Twinsen]] about the big jack-pot he could win there. However, when arriving at the jack-pot room, Twinsen was attacked by two gloums who tried to steal his money. Being stronger and wiser than them, Twinsen was able to defeat them.

==Unconfirmed theories==
A few things are rather a mystery regarding the gloums. First of all, it unknown where they originated from. Secondly, since there seem to be only male gloums, it is uknown how they reproduce. And third thing, no one seems to know why the gloums live only in Otringal, and work nowhere except at the casino.
