'''Gloums''' are large Alligator-like creatures on [[Otringal]]. Almost all gloums there work in [[Casino Gloum]]. The Gloums may seem like a friendly species at a first glance, but they are in fact a race of frauds and will steal [[Twinsen]]'s [[Zlito]]s any chance they get (especially [[Patrick]]).

Owning the casino in the [[middle city]] of Otrinal, the gloums tell [[Twinsen]] about the big jack-pot he can win there. However, when arriving at the [[Jackpot Room]], Twinsen is attacked by two gloums, who steal all of his money in case they defeat him. After Twinsen beats them, he can exit the casino through the back door, leading to Otringal's [[Upper City]].
