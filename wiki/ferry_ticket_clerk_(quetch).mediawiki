The '''ferry ticket clerk''' is a [[quetch]] working as a [[ferry ticket|ticket]] seller for the Inter-Island Ferries in the [[Citadel Island harbour|Harbour]] of [[Citadel Island]].

Every time [[Twinsen]] wants to board a [[ferry]] from Citadel Island in [[Little Big Adventure 2]], he must go into the Ferry building, and buy a ticket from the seller. If Twinsen goes to the tickets office before learning from [[Leone]] that he should go to [[Desert Island]], then the clerk recommends him to read the poster advertising the [[Temple of Bu]]. Before reading the poster, it's not possible to choose to buy a ferry ticket.

The clerk has an assisitant behind the counter with him, named [[Mrs. Brune]].
