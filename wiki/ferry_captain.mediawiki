==Description==
The ferry captain is a nameless rabbibunny working for the Inter-Island Ferry services as a captain. Every time a ferry is ready to take off, it is his job to sail the ferry to its desired destination, as well as conducting the passenger's [[Ferry ticket|tickets]]. He seems to be pretty friendly towards his passengers, perhaps due to the fact that hard times resulted in very few inter-island travellers.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
While in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], [[Twinsen]] travelled several times from [[Citadel Island]] to [[Principal Island]] in a ferry. Upon reaching the ferry, he was encountered by the captain, who made sure he had a proper ticket (a job he apparently failed to fullfill, as Twinsen's ticket was actually counterfeit sometimes), and then sail the ferry to the desired destination.
Once buying his catamaran, Twinsen found no further use of the ferry services, resulting in not meeting the captain any more.

==Trivia==
By the time of Twinsen's second adventure, the captain was nowhere around any more, and his job was taken by a [[grobo]] named [[Mr. Paul]]. It is unknown where the rabbibunny has disappeared.
