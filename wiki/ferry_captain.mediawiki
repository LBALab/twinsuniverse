The '''ferry captain''' is a [[rabbibunny]] working for the Inter-Island Ferry services as a [[ferry]] captain. Every time a ferry is ready to take off, it is his job to sail the ferry to its desired destination, as well as conducting the passenger's [[Ferry ticket|tickets]].

While in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], [[Twinsen]] travels several times from [[Citadel Island]] to [[Principal Island]] in a ferry. When reaching the ferry, he is encountered by the captain, who makes sure he has a ticket, and then sails the ferry to the desired destination.

Once buying his [[catamaran]], Twinsen finds no further use of the ferry services, resulting in not meeting the captain any more.
