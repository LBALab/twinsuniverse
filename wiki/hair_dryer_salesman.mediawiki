The '''hair dryer salesman''' ia a [[quetch]] selling door-to-door [[hair dryer]]s on several islands around the [[Southern Hemisphere]] of [[Twinsun]].

Twinsen first sees him at the [[Old Burg]] in [[Principal Island]], unsuccessfully trying to sell hair dryers. He later tries his luck on [[Proxima Island]] too, where Twinsen meets him again. This time, Twinsen needs a hair dryer, following [[Baldino]]'s request to get one for him in order to complete the [[proto-pack]]. The salesman sells Twinsen a hair dryer for 30 [[kashes]], despite it not being a door-to-door sale. Twinsen then gives the hair dryer to Baldino, who completes the proto-ppack.
