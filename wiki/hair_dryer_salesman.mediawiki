==Description==
[[Image:Hairdryer.png|right|52px|frame|Hair dryer]]
The hairdryer salesman is a pretty lazy quetch, apparently without a name. As the descriptive title may suggest, his job is to sell [[hairdryer|hairdryers]] to the people at various islands on [[Twinsun]]'s [[southern hemisphere]]. The price of the hairdryer may vary, and it would usually depend on how successfull his selling day was.
Very few is known about this quetch, although it seems that he isn't exactly a chatty person.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Following [[Baldino]]'s request, [[Twinsen]] went out to search for a hairdryer so that the [[proto-pack]] could be completed. Twinsen met the hairdryer salesman, who sold him a hairdryer for a pretty high price- 30 [[kashes]]. Twinsen was then able to give the hairdryer to Baldino, who in no time at all completed his work on the proto-pack.
