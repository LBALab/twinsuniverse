'''Terrain soldiers''' are the basic soldiers in [[FunFrock]]'s army. They can be seen with a yellow suit on the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]], with a white suit in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]], and with a green one everywhere else. They're omnipresent. They are patrolling in nearly every public place, like [[Lupin Burg]], the [[Old Burg]] and the rest of [[Principal Island]], the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxima Island]], in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]] and at all fortresses and factories of FunFrock. There's a [[military camp]] on Principal and Desert Island.

The terrain soldiers are major enemies of [[Twinsen]]. He encounters them at many different places in his adventure, and has to fight them in various fortresses and factories, sometimes to get a [[key]]. However, they are easy to defeat most of the time.

In [[Peg Leg street]], Twinsen encounters a terrain soldier having a pee at nearby trees. While the soldier is absent, Twinsen is able to steal his bike to get to the [[water tower]].

In the [[Old Burg]], there is a soldier standing in front of a poster. When Twinsen pays 10 [[kashes]], he is allowed to look at it:

The average soldier seems to be quite lazy. A few soldiers are seen sleeping on the grass when on duty. Also, their level of intelligence does not appear to be very high. When Twinsen emerges from the [[Principal Island prison]], he is stopped by a soldier, but is able to pass by saying he is Santa Claus.

Though the soldiers have human attributes, it is speculated that they are in fact [[Quetch]] clones.
