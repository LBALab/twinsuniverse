==Description==
'''Terrain soldiers''' are the basic soldiers in [[FunFrock]]'s army. They can be seen with a yellow suit on the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]], with a white suit in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]], and with a green one everywhere else. They're omnipresent. They are patrolling in nearly every public place, like [[Lupin Burg]], the [[Old Burg]] and the rest of [[Principal Island]], the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxima Island]], in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]] and at all fortresses and factories of FunFrock. There's a [[military camp]] on Principal and Desert Island.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The terrain soldiers were major enemies of [[Twinsen]]. He encountered them at many different places in his adventure, and had to fight them in various fortresses and factories, sometimes to get a [[key]]. However, they were easy to defeat most of the time.

==Trivia==
In [[Peg Leg street]], Twinsen encountered a terrain soldier having a pee at nearby trees. While the soldier was absent, he was able to steal his bike to get to the [[water tower]].

In the [[Old Burg]], there was a soldier standing in front of a poster. When Twinsen paid 10 [[kashes]], he was allowed to look at it:

==Unconfirmed Theories==
The average soldier seems to be quite lazy. Twinsen saw many soldiers sleeping in the grass when on duty.

Also, there intelligence appears to be not very high. When Twinsen emerged from the [[Principal Island prison]], he was stopped by a soldier, but was able to pass when saying he was Santa Claus.

Though the soldiers have human attributes, it is speculated if there were in fact [[Quetch]] clones.
