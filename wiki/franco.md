**Franco** is one of the four main species of the planet
[Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"). Their shape resembles a sausage, and most
of them live in the [Island of the
Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"), on [Zeelich's
surface](Zeelich's_surface "wikilink").

A plaque in [Dark Monk's temple](Dark_Monk's_temple "wikilink")
describes the Francos as so:

As can be seen, the refining of [gazogem](gazogem "wikilink") from
[gems](gem "wikilink") in the [gazogem
refinery](gazogem_refinery "wikilink") provides a main income source for
the Francos. This is also mentioned in their description in the official
[Little Big Adventure 2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink") website:

During his adventures in Zeelich, Twinsen mainly finds Francos in
Francos Island. At that time, most of them are searching for the lost
[Francos Fragment](Francos_Fragment "wikilink"). There are also quite a
lot of Francos in [Otringal](Otringal "wikilink") and the [Island of the
Wannies](Island_of_the_Wannies "wikilink"), mainly serving as
[guards](franco_guard "wikilink") and policemen. During the
[Emperor](Emperor "wikilink")'s invasion of the [Island of the
Mosquibees](Island_of_the_Mosquibees "wikilink"), the Francos are
serving as parachuters. A few Franco guards also come to
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") with the [Esmers](Esmer "wikilink").

"Franco" is perhaps a pun on "Frankfurt", the city famous for its
sausage industry.
