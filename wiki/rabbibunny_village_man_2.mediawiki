The '''Rabbibunny Village man''' is one of four residents of the [[Rabbibunny Village]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. 

When [[Twinsen]] first reaches the village, he finds this rabbibunny standing at the edge of the village, by a car track that leads to the [[Mutant Factory]]. He is constantly being attacked by a [[mutant]], and whenever Twinsen saves him from the mutant he is rewarded with a [[clover leaf]].

After Twinsen destroys the Mutant Factory this villager can be seen walking up and down the carrot garden in the village. He gives Twinsen a clue of the location of the [[Clear Water Lake]] by saying it is very near the village.
