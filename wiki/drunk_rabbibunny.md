The **drunk rabbibunny** is a nameless
[rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") who sits in [Chez
Luc](Chez_Luc "wikilink") at the beginning of [Little Big Adventure
2](Little_Big_Adventure_2 "wikilink"). The rabbibunny is injured,
because he once fell down the hall in the pub's cellar.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") does not have to talk to this rabbibunny,
but he can receive from him a clue about the hole in cellar, leading
down to the [sewers](Citadel_Island_sewers "wikilink"), where Twinsen
finds [Sendell's Ball](Sendell's_Ball "wikilink").
