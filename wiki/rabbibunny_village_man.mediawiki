==Description==
One of four residents in the [[Rabbibunny Village]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. He is seen standing by the huts being attacked by a mutant when [[Twinsen]] first enters the village.
Every time Twinsen saves the villager from the mutant, he is rewarded with a clover, which in turn makes this non-important character in LBA1 quite helpful.

This particular [[rabbibunny]] seems to have a Scottish accent.
