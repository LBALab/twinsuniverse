==Description==

The '''Rabbibunny Village man''' is one of four residents in the [[Rabbibunny Village]] at the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. He is seen standing by the huts being attacked by a [[mutant]] when [[Twinsen]] first enters the village.

Every time Twinsen saves the villager from the mutant, he is rewarded with a [[clover leaf]], which in turn makes this non-important character quite helpful.

This particular [[rabbibunny]] seems to have a Scottish accent.
