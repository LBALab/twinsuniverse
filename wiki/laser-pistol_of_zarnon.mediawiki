==Description==
This '''laser pistol''' requires a piece of [[rock crystal]] to work. Once loaded with such crystal, the laser-pistol is able to fire short, perfectly horizontal and slow moving laser rays that explode upon impact. It does lots of damage, and due to the horizontal rays it has a very long range. However, it reloads very slowly.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
To help him in his quest, the Dissidents awarded [[Twinsen]] with the Laser Pistol of Zarnon. Twinsen had to use this pistol to get past the [[Franco guards|guards]] and open the door at the passage to the [[Elevator to the Undergas]]. It did a great deal of damage, and was therefore a very good weapon to use. However, Twinsen was usually not wise enough to realize that, and did not use the pistol too often.
