The '''laser pistol of Zarnon''', usually referred to as '''laser-pistol''', is a pistol loaded with [[rock crystal]]. This pistol fires short, perfectly horizontal and slow moving laser rays that explode upon impact. It causes lots of damage, and due to the horizontal rays it has a very long range. However, it reloads very slowly.

[[Twinsen]] receives the laser pistol from the [[dissidents]] in the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]] when they help him prepare for the journey to [[Island CX]]. They instruct him to load the pistol with rock crystal mined from the [[Island of the Celebration]]. Twinsen goes there, and with a [[pick-ax]] he buys from the [[Francos bazaar]], he mines the rock crystal and loads the pistol with it.

Without the pistol, Twinsen cannot reach the levers that control the door leading to the [[Francos harbour]], from which he takes a tanker to the [[Elevator to the Undergas]].

The laser pistol also serves as an effective weapon, especially against far away enemies.
