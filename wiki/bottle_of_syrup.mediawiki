The '''Bottle of Syrup''' is a bottle containing 1/2 liter of cherry-flavored syrup, used for either curing purposes, or just for flavour.

Needing to change the water flavour in [[Principal Island]], [[Twinsen]] goes to the [[pharmacy]] of [[Citadel Island]] to take this syrup. He then goes to the [[Water Tower]] of Principal Island, and by pouring the syrup into the water tank, he changes the water's flavour. In return to doing so, the [[librarian]] lets Twinsen into the Restricted Section of the [[library]], where Twinsen reads about [[the legend]].

Later in the game, Twinsen fills the now empty flask with the [[Flask of Clear Water|Clear Water]].
