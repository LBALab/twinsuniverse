Character=Official description}}

== Description ==
This bottle contains 1/2 liter of cherry-flavored syrup, used for either curing purposes, or just for flavour.

== Role in Twinsen's adventure ==
[[Twinsen]] had to travel back to [[Citadel Island]] to a local [[pharmacy]], and steal this '''bottle of syrup''', so that he could later pour it into the [[Principal Island]] [[Water Tower]]. This was based on the request of a [[Rabbibunny]] at a [[library]], who found the water taste in the island strange. When the quest was successfully completed, the librarian showed Twinsen a book in the Restricted Section of the library, at which information regarding “[[The Legend]]” was disclosed.

Later in his adventure, Twinsen filled the now empty flask with the [[Flask of Clear Water|Clear Water]].
