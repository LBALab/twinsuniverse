==Description==
These '''darts''' do little damage, and only on very weak enemies, such as snakes and crabs. Three darts are usually available for the price of 4 [[kashes]], but they can also be found for free at some places. After throwing a dart, it can be retreived by simply walking over it.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The darts did not have a specific role in [[Twinsen]]'s second adventure. It was, however, possible to throw the darts at [[FunFrock]]'s statue in the back of [[Twinsen's house]] to get [[life points]] popped out, or to use them at the duck shooting game in [[Temple of Bu|Temple Park]], in order to win balloons that brought Twinsen through an alternative route into the Temple of BÃ¹.
