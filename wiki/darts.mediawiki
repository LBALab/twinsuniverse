==Description==
These '''darts''' do little damage, and only on very weak enemies, such as snakes and crabs. Three darts are usually available for the price of 4 [[kashes]], but they can also be found for free at some places. After throwing a dart, it can be retrieved by simply walking over it.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The darts did not have a specific role in [[Twinsen]]'s second adventure. It was, however, possible to throw the darts at [[FunFrock]]'s statue in the back of [[Twinsen's house]]. When the darts hit the tomato on the statue, [[life points]] popped out. Twinsen could also use them at the duck shooting game in [[Temple of Bu|Temple Park]], in order to win balloons that brought him through an alternative route into the Temple of BÃ¹.
