The '''rummaging rabbibunny''' is a [[rabbibunny]] whose name is unknown, who ramages in a pile of garbage next to the [[Citadel]]. He hides inside the garbage truck to get into the area which is closed to the public.

When [[Twinsen]] escapes from the Citadel, he has to find a way through the closed and heavily guarded gate. He encounters the rummaging rabbibunny at the nearby pile of garbage, and gets the hint to hide inside the garbage truck in order to get out of the closed area.
