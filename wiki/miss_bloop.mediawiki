'''Miss Bloop''' is a femal [[grobo]] owning a [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum|musem]] on [[Citadel Island]]. This museum is dedicated to [[Twinsen]] and his first adventure.

After the events of [[Little Big Adventure 1]], Twinsen landed his [[Ancestral Tunic]] and [[Sendell's Medallion]] to Miss Bloop's museum. When he needs them again in the beginning of [[Little Big Adventure 2]], he goes to the museum to fetch them. There, he learns from Miss Bloop that the door to the control room of the museum is locked, and thus the tunic and the medallion cannot be reached. After Twinsen manages to open the door and take his belongings, Miss Bloop gives him a hint regarding the tunic, saying that the trajectory of the [[magic ball]] changes with his [[behaviour]].
