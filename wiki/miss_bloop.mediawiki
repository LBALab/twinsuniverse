'''Miss Bloop''' is a female [[grobo]] owning a [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum|musem]] on [[Citadel Island]]. This museum is dedicated to [[Twinsen]] and his [[FunFrock's Reign|first adventure]]. She keeps [[Ancestral Tunic|Twinsen's tunic]] and [[Sendell's Medallion]] in a safe display stand.

After the events of FunFrock's Reign, Twinsen lent his Tunic and Medallion to Miss Bloop's museum. When he needs them again at the start of [[Twinsen's Odyssey]], he goes to the museum to fetch them. There, he learns from Miss Bloop that the door to the control room of the museum is jammed, and thus the tunic and the medallion cannot be reached. After Twinsen manages to open the door and take his belongings, Miss Bloop gives him a hint regarding the tunic, saying that the trajectory of the [[Magic Ball]] changes with his [[behaviour]].
