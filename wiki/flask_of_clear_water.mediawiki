==Description==
As described in the [[Book of Bù]], the '''vial of Clear Water''' is one of the four magical items have to be collected by the Chosen One, if he "hopes to be victorious". While the vial itself was of less importance, the water required to posses was of a very special and rare kind: water from the [[Clear Water Lake]], which is located at the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. However, gathering water from this lake during the reign of Dr. [[FunFrock]] was not an easy task at all. Not only was the access to the lake blocked by terrifying soldiers and [[clones]], but also is it frozen throughout the entire year. The Heir, when his time arrives, would require to find ways to overcome the clones, as well as to melt the water, thus gaining access to the desired Clear Water.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
As described above, [[Twinsen]] had to fetch a vial with Clear Water as one of the four magical symbols described in the sacred Book of Bù. Once he reached the Hamalayi Ranges with the rebels, though, he found out that reaching the lake won't be very simple. Not only were the clones patrolling everywhere around, but also was the access there blocked by a carrot door, sacred to the residents of the [[Rabbibunny Village]]. By destroying the [[Mutants Factory]], and thus preventing any [[mutants]] from disturbing the peaceful life of the innocent rabbibunnes, Twinsen was able to gain their trust. Thus, the [[rabbibunnies]] were willing to open the sacred door for him, allowing him to reach the Clear Water lake.

Once at the lake, Twinsen found out disappointendly, that the lake is frozen. However, using the advice the old and wise Rabbibunny at the [[White Leaf Desert|desert]] gave him once, he was able to melt the water at the lake, using the [[magic flute]] he achieved after freeing one of the [[Runic Stones]] at [[Proxima Island]]. Once the lake unfroze, Twinsen took out his now-empty flask, which once contained [[cherry syrup]], and filled it with Clear Water.

The water came to real use only afterwards. At his visit to the [[Teleportation Centre]], Twinsen eventually reached a dead end, at the room of the third Runic Stone. Knowing that the stone is indestructible, Twinsen poured some Clear Water at it, then quickly made his way out of the building. A few seconds later, the building has exploded completely, leaving behind only ruins, as well as the Runic Stone. Also, this explosion has revealed the secret access to the [[Construction Zone]], at which Twinsen was just about to end his first adventure.

==Trivia==
Nearing the end of his adventure, when coming back to [[Principal Island]], Twinsen poured the remaining water into the [[Water Tower]] tank. In reward for improving the taste of the water, he has received three [[clover leaves]] from the [[librarian]].

At the end of this adventure, Twinsen found no use of the vial any more. Therefore, he contributed the now-empty flask to [[Miss Bloop's private museum]], which contained some more items that symbolized his first adventure.

Quote=The day will come when someone from the present or future species will rise up and say, 'This world is mine from now on, and the key to all powers belongs to me!' This day will surely come because avarice and violence harbor in the hearts of all species of the universe. If the peril on this day is too great, the Chosen One will come forth. He will rise up against the tyrant and overthrow him. He will free and reunite the people, because throughout the years, the Chosen One's ancestors will have prepared him for his victory. They will have left information and weapons in his dwelling. The Chosen One, also known as the Heir, will, however, have to gather together four magical symbols if he hopes to be victorious: the Tunic, the Book of Bש, Sendell's Medallion and a Flask of Clear Water. On the day of peril Sendell will visit the Heir in his sleep and announce the coming of the final combat. The Heir will then have to go to the Well of Sendell where the goddess will endow her powers on him!|
