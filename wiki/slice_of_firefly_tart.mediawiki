==Description==
The '''Firefly Tart''' is a food product made and eaten by the [[Wannies]]. It is made from the fireflies easily found around their island.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Searching for a way to reach the [[Mosquibees Island]], [[Twinsen]] reached the [[Village of the Wannies]]. There, a note written by [[Annie]], the housemaid of [[Dark Monk's priest]], clued the [[quetch]] to ask the priest about it. Unfortunately, the door to [[Dark Monk's chapel|the chapel]] leading to the priest's house was locked. However, Twinsen was lucky enough to meet an old wannie at the village. This wannie owned the [[key]] to the door, and was willing to give it to Twinsen in return for a slice of firefly tart.

Searching for such a tart, Twinsen arrived at the house of a small family living in the village. Being kind enough, the wannies invited Twinsen to share their meal. After fainting once hearing what it was he has just eaten, Twinsen took a slice of the tart for the old wannie, who in return gave the quetch the key to the chapel.
