'''Lemuzard''' is a creature used in a betting-game at the [[Casino]] in [[Otringal]].

In this game, the betting person can place his bet of 1 [[zlito]] on any of the four holes at an arena. If the Lemuzard enters this hole, the person receives 10 [[zlitos]].

[[Twinsen]] can use the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]] to cheat in this game; if the Lemuzard touches the [[life candy]] thrown from it, he is more likely to enter the hole Twinsen bets on.
