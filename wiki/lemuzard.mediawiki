==Description==
This creature is used in a betting-game.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
One of the games in the [[casino]] was getting this creature come to you. [[Twinsen]] could do this by using the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]]. He didn't have to shoot [[hearts]], just pretending like he wanted to do it was enough. Twinsen had to pay 1 [[Zlito]] to play and got 10 if he won.
