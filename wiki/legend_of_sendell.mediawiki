Quote=In the distant past, when the spheros, rabbibunnies, Quetches and grobos emerged from the original primordial soup, centuries before Dr. FunFrock's coup, a prophecy was pronounced. Its text is hardly remembered today and that is why people now refer to it as the "Legend". It explained how "the Heir," when his time had come, would be called to overthrow a tyrant! The secret of the Legend can still be learned somewhere in the White Leaf Desert.|

Quote=The day will come when someone from the present or future species will rise up and say, 'This world is mine from now on, and the key to all powers belongs to me!' This day will surely come because avarice and violence harbor in the hearts of all species of the universe. If the peril on this day is too great, the Chosen One will come forth. He will rise up against the tyrant and overthrow him. He will free and reunite the people, because throughout the years, the Chosen One's ancestors will have prepared him for his victory. They will have left information and weapons in his dwelling. The Chosen One, also known as the Heir, will, however, have to gather together four magical symbols if he hopes to be victorious: the Tunic, the Book of Bù, Sendell's Medallion and a Flask of Clear Water. On the day of peril Sendell will visit the Heir in his sleep and announce the coming of the final combat. The Heir will then have to go to the Well of Sendell where the goddess will endow her powers on him!|

==Description==
The Legend, as Twinsunians refer to it, tells the story of the Heir. He is the descendant of a line of chosen creatures who live on the surface to serve [[Sendell]] in times of danger. The Legend comes to bitter truth in [[Twinsen]]'s first adventure.

Twinsen, as far as he knows, is a common quetch living on Twinsun during the dictatorship of Dr. [[FunFrock]]. He has strange dreams in which Sendell is calling him. When he tells someone (the [[pharmacist (quetch)|pharmacist]]) about it, he is imprisoned in the [[Citadel]], a place from which no one had ever escaped. Twinsen still manages to flee and goes home to his girlfriend [[Zoé]].

She, too, is imprisoned and taken away by FunFrock's soldiers. In the search for his girlfriend and the truth about the Legend, he discovers that he in fact is the very Heir, destined to overthrow the evil tyrant FunFrock, as described in the Legend itself.

==Additional quotes==
The next quotes describe how the legend came true in Twinsen's first adventure.

Quote=Only the Heir could have survived in that Temple! You are the Chosen One that the prophecy spoke of. You are worthy of keeping the Book of Bù, Twinsen. It will allow you to decipher the runes and to speak to the animals. The prophecy that must be accomplished is also revealed in its pages: you must overthrow Dr. FunFrock, the despot who has destroyed the harmony that once existed on this planet. In my dreams, I saw him profaning the Well of Sendell, which caused the immediate destruction of this world. You must go to the Well of Sendell to save us from Dr. FunFrock. I don't know where this well is, but your ancestors must have left instructions for you, somewhere in your home.|

Quote=This room contains information and weapons that were amassed for generations to help the Heir who will, one day, be chosen from our descendants. The key to the room was passed down from generation to generation, but our ancestor Hégésippe was the last family member to retain the key. He was attacked and killed by the ruthless pirate LeBorgne during a sea voyage. Nobody knows where Leborgne's treasure, which undoubtedly contains the golden key to the room, is today.|

Quote=You who read this text, know that there are 3 Runic Stones in this world. Their locations are now indicated on your Holomap. They are large menhirs with runic text written on them. They will help the Heir in his quest for Sendell. The third stone will show the exact location of the Well of Sendell. In addition to the help provided by the text, each stone conceals a secret.|

{{Quote|
Quote=I am Sendell, like all of those you see here, we are all Sendells. We are here to watch over a stellar entity that is in gestation, it will come into existence in a few centuries. As we can only act from the heart of the planet, we implanted a lineage of elected creatures among the species living on the surface. You are the current descendant of this family, and when FunFrock's threat had become too great, it was me that called to you in your dreams. The entity can now finish its gestation because you rid us of FunFrock. It would have died if he had gotten to it, and this world would have imploded, thanks to you it will continue to flourish. Return now to the surface, you can now erase the final traces that he left there.|
