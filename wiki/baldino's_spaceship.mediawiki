'''Baldino's Spaceship''' is a spaceship created by [[Jerome Baldino]]. It is a long, grey ship. It has some windows on its sides. Its side door automatically opens when someone approaches it.

It can run with [[Gas|Twinsunian fuel]] or [[Can of Gazogem|gazogem]].

The spaceship is the first spacecraft created by a [[Twinsun]]ian. It was developed secretly by Baldino at his home in [[Port-Ludo]] and stored under a giant tarpaulin next to his [[Jerome Baldino's residence|house]]. Baldino created the plans for it on his blackboard.

Baldino's Spaceship serves several times during Little Big Adventure 2.

Shortly before the children of Twinsun are kidnapped by the [[Esmers]] at the [[Ridge of the Flowers Circle]] on [[Citadel Island]], Baldino notices "strange things" on [[Emerald Moon]] with his powerful telescope. Alarmed, he uses his spaceship to get to the [[Emerald Moon base]], where he is subsequently captured by the Esmers.

[[Twinsen]] follows him using an [[Esmer shuttle]]. After Baldino is freed, both escape from the Moon using the Spaceship again. They approach [[Zeelich]], in order to destroy the control centre for the lunar reactors on [[Island CX]].

However, the ship runs out of fuel, so Twinsen and Baldino crash-land on [[Otringal]]. The ship gets severly damaged and needs a long time to get repaired.

With his technical skills and probably the help of the Twinsunian wizards, Baldino finishes the repairs on his ship just in time when Twinsen is facing [[FunFrock]]. He manueveres the ship into [[Dark Monk's statue]] through a hole on its back. When FunFrock releases the cage with the children inside, attempting to throw it into the lava, it is caught by Baldino's Spaceship hovering above the lava.

After FunFrock's defeat, Twinsen and Baldino use the spaceship to emerge from Zeelich and head back to Twinsun, which is still threatened by the Emerald Moon.
