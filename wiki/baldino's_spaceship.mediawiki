==Description==
'''Baldino's Spaceship''' is a spaceship created by [[Jerome Baldino]]. It is a long, grey ship. It has some windows on its sides. Its side door automatically opens when someone approaches it.

It can run with [[Gas|Twinsunian fuel]] or [[Gazogem]].

The spaceship is the first spacecraft created by a [[Twinsun]]ian. It was developed secretly by Baldino at his home in [[Port Ludo]] and stored under a giant tarpaulin next to his [[Jerome Baldino's residence|house]]. Baldino created the plans for it on his blackboard.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

Baldino's Spaceship served several times during [[Twinsen]]'s second adventure.

Shortly before the children of Twinsun were kidnapped by the [[Esmers]] at the [[Ridge of the Flowers Circle]] on [[Citadel Island]], Baldino noticed "strange things" on [[Emerald Moon]] with his powerful telescope. Alarmed, he used his spaceship to get to the [[Emerald Moon base]], where he was subsequently captured by the Esmers.

Twinsen followed him using an [[Esmer shuttle]]. After Baldino was freed, both escaped from the Moon using the Spaceship again. The approached [[Zeelich]], in order to destroy the control centre for the lunar reactors on [[Island CX]].

However, the ship ran out of fuel, so Twinsen and Baldino crash-landed on [[Otringal]]. The ship got severly damaged and needed a long time to get repaired.

With his technical skills and probably the help of the Twinsunian wizards, Baldino finished the repairs on his ship just in time when Twinsen was facing [[FunFrock]]. He manoeuvred the ship into [[Dark Monk's statue]] through a hole on its back. When FunFrock released the cage with the children inside, attempting to throw it into the lava, it was caught by Baldino's Spaceship hovering above the lava.

After FunFrock's defeat, Twinsen and Baldino used the spaceship to emerge from Zeelich and head back to Twinsun which was still threatened by the Emerald Moon.
