==Description==
'''Twinsen's car''' is a yellow buggy owned by [[Twinsen]]. It has a cannon under its hood, which has the power of Twinsen's [[Magic Ball|Magic Level]]. When driving over a ramp, it can jump high and far.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Twinsen needed the car to get the [[Garden Balsam Flower]]. It was on a tall mountain in the [[White Leaf Desert]], which could only be reached by jumping over a gap from a nearby mountain using the car. 

However, the car first needed repairs. Twinsen fetched a [[car part]] from [[Jerome Baldino]], and his wife [[ZoÃ©]] fixed the car with it for him. She then brought it to [[Desert Island]] with the [[ferry]].

With the car, Twinsen was able to get the Garden Balsam Flower and thus finish the second test of the [[School of Magic]]. Twinsen later used the car for races at [[von Kournil Tour]] and travelling long distances on Desert Island. He also used the car's powerful gun to defeat Esmer robots during the [[Esmer]] invasion.

==Trivia==
Eventually, Twinsen lost his car on the mountain of the Garden Balsam Flower. He was no longer able to get up to the mountain to get his car. However, the racer at von Kournil Tour found it and sold it Twinsen back for 50 [[Kash]]es.
