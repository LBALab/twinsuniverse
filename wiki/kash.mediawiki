==Description==
'''Kashes''' are the [[currency]] on [[Twinsun]], [[Twinsen]]'s planet. They are used by the inhabitants of the planet to buy anything they wish.

The kashes can be easily found almost anywhere around the planet, by searching rubbish cans or plants.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
Twinsen used Kashes in order to buy anything he was interested in. Once arriving on [[Zeelich]], he found no further use for them, and was more than happy to sell them to the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]], in exchange for [[Zlitos]].
