'''Kashes''' are the currency unit on [[Twinsun]]. They are used by the inhabitants of the planet to buy items they want. Kashes can be easily found almost anywhere around the planet, by searching rubbish cans or plants.

[[Twinsen]] uses Kashes in order to buy anything he is interested in. Once arriving on [[Zeelich]], he finds no further use for them, and sells them to the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]], in exchange for [[Zlitos]].
