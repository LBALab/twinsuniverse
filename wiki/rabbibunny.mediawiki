A highly evolved race of long-legged rabbits who walk on two legs and run incredibly fast. Apart from that, girlybunnies, otherwise known as rabbibunnettes, are extremely well endowed by nature. These characters are avid workers and do everything with the greatest enthusiasm, whether its fishing or drinking a toast. They're funny little guys too!
