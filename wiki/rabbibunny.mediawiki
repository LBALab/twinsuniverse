'''Rabbibunny''' is one of the four main species of [[Twinsun]]. The name is deprived from a combination of the words "rabbit" and "bunny", due to their body shape.

These creatures have long legs and can run very fast. Their skin colour varies from light to dark brown. There are also several types of [[rabbibunny clone]]s.

Rabbibunnies are common everywhere around Twinsun, and there is even a [[Rabbibunny Village]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]], consisting entirely of rabbibnnies.
