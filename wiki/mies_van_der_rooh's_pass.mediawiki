'''Mies van der Rooh's pass''' is a card which [[Mies van der Rooh]] uses to enter the [[Teleportation Center]] in [[Brundle Island]].

When [[Twinsen]] goes to Mies van der Rooh in his search for the plans of the Teleportation Center, he receives this pass from him. When Twinsen reaches the Teleportation Center, a [[nurse]] guarding the site asks for his identification. By showing him the architect's pass, Twinsen is able to safely pass through the gate and enter the building.

The [[inventory]] description of the architect's pass gives a hint, saying that the [[Horn of Gawley]] is needed to enter the building.
