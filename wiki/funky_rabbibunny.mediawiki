==Description==
Down in the streets of [[Funky-Town]], where a small population of dissidents is rebelling against [[FunFrock]], patrols a nameless rabbibunny. The city probably received its name from people of his type, funky and cool.
Although not being too appreciated by his town mates, this nameless rabbibunny is perhaps the smartest and most knowledgable person of the entire [[Tippett Island|island]]. For a decent price, he is willing to sell whoever's interested information regarding FunFrock's evil plans.
Further than that, very few is known about his personality. He seems to be a loner, who doesn't chat too much.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
If we consider the fact that most of the characters [[Twinsen]] met during his adventure were of no importance except for giving some hints, then we can notice that this funky rabbibunny was very useful in the [[quetch]]'s quests. For the total price of 30 [[kashes]] (10 kashes for each factory), the rabbibunny was able to tell Twinsen anything he ever wanted to know about FunFrock's three factories- the [[Cloning Center]], the [[Teleportation Center]] and the [[Mutant Factory]].
After speaking with the rabbibunny, Twinsen realized he needed the plans of the Teleportation Centre, and thus started asking anyone he saw about their whereabouts.

==Additional quotes==
{{Quote|
Quote=FunFrock cleared out the populations from this hemisphere but there are still a few people that resist like here in Funky-Town. He produces mutant insects in his factory at the foot of the Hamalayi mountains to exterminate us. The factory was supposedly sabotaged, but there are still monsters in the sewers: they were produced before the sabotage. In fact, you can jump on the giant crabs!|

Quote=The center where all the planet's clones are produced is inside FunFrock's Fortress. It's his headquarters when he is in this hemisphere. Be careful because I heard that he is working on some VERY special clones, it's on Fortress island.|
