The '''funky rabbibunny''' is a nameless [[rabbibunny]] patrolling in [[Funky-Town]] at [[Tippett Island]]. This rabbibunny claims to know the [[Northern Hemisphere]] of [[Twinsun]] very well, and is willing to sell information for the price of 10 [[kashes]].

Following the advice of a [[sphero]] he meets when arriving to Tippett Island, [[Twinsen]] goes to talk with the rabbibunny, who for 10 kashes on each item sells him the information he knows regarding the [[Cloning Center]], the [[Teleportation Center]] and the [[Mutant Factory]].

The rabbibunny hints Twinsen that it is possible to jump on the [[crabs]] in the [[sewers]] as a way of crossing the water, and that he needs a proper ID card to enter the Teleportation Center.
