'''Annie''' is a [[wannie]] working as the [[Priest]]'s housemaid. She lives with her only son in a small house in the [[Village of the Wannies]].

Twinsen has to go to other islands in the [[under-gas]]. Not knowing how to contact the [[ferryman]], he goes to the village of the wannies, where the Priest tells him to ask his housemaid about it. Twinsen then goes to Annie, who teaches him the [[Ferryman's Song]], which is required to call the ferryman.

Hitting Annie results in her hitting Twinsen back with her broom.
