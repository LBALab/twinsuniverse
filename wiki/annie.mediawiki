==Description==
Annie is the Priest's housemaid. She lives with her only son at a small house in the [[Village of the Wannies]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Twinsen had to go to other islands in the [[under-gas]]. He knew he could travel with the help of the [[ferryman]], but not how to get in contact with him. The Priest of the Wannies told Twinsen to ask his housemaid about it. Twinsen then went to Annie, who taught him the [[Ferryman's Song]], the song required to call the ferryman.
It was also better for Twinsen not to hurt her, as she also could give some painful hits with her broom.

Quote=Of course, it's fairly simple. You have to pay him in gems if you want him to take you. But first you have to call him. To do that, you have to stand at the end of the ferryman's pier and call him with this song. Listen to me and don't forget.|

Quote=The Monk impatiently awaits the ceremony of the celebration. It's a major event for our entire population. It represents the end of the curse which lies heavily upon Zeelich. We shall at last resume the course of our lives on a hospitable planet, not in this forlorn place.|

Quote=For that, you'll have to call on the ferryman's services. He provides the only communication between the islands and the under-gas. Go see my housemaid. She shall tell you how to proceed.|
