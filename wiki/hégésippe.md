**Hégésippe** was an ancestor of [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink"). He was
the last to hold the [key to the Heir's
room](key_to_the_Heir's_room "wikilink"), before he was killed by the
pirate [LeBorgne](LeBorgne "wikilink"). This story is scribed on runes
at a cave near [Twinsen's House](Twinsen's_House "wikilink").

Twinsen finds the lost key in LeBorgne's treasure in the [Maritime
Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink") on [Proxima
Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink"), and uses it to enter the locked room
in the cave.
