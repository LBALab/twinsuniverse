## Description

**Zlitos** are the currency of [Zeelich](Zeelich "wikilink"), planet of
the [esmers](esmer "wikilink"). The esmers use them to buy anything
they're interested in.

However, unlike the [kashes](kash "wikilink") on
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"), it is much less likely to find Zlitos by
searching rubbish bins and plants.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

With the Zlitos, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") bought anything he was
interested in on Zeelich.
