title: Telepod
---

== Description ==
'''Telepods''' are devices used for teleportation. They were found all over [[Twinsun]] during [[Dr. FunFrock]]'s regime. All telepods are connected to the [[Teleportation Center]], from where [[clone]]s can be sent to any place of the planet in a matter of seconds. Telepods are also found inside [[Dark Monk's statue]].

It is said that only clones can use telepods and they are dangerous for all species. However, FunFrock himself (or clones of him) uses the telepods several times. As well, [[Elf|Elves]] seem to be attracted to telepods and get teleported to them against their will.

Telepods can be destroyed with the enhanced [[Nitro-Meca-Penguin]]s, but not with Meca-Penguins.

== Role in Twinsen's Adventures ==
[[Twinsen]] had to avoid telepods several times during his first adventure, as [[Supergro]]s could come out of them, sending him to prison. He also had to defeat clones who came out of telepods several times. After he had destroyed the Teleportation Center, the telepods were no longer working, and stopped being a threat to Twinsen.

In his second adventure, in [[Dark Monk]]'s statue, Twinsen also had to defeat some clones from telepods to open a locked entrance.
