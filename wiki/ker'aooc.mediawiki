In a search for a cure for his [[Dino-Fly]], [[Twinsen]] meets Leone in the [[pharmacy]] of [[Citadel Island]]. She advices him to go meet Ker'aooc in [[Ker'aooc's house|his house]] in Desert Island. When Twinsen arrives to Desert Island, he finds out that Ker'aooc is not home. Leone tells him that she is worried about that, becuase he usually doesn't disappear for too long. Twinsen later finds out that Ker'aooc, together with the other [[wizards]] of the planet, went with the [[Esmers]] to [[Zeelich]], as an exchange trip. Leone tells Twinsen that if it's an emergency, he can try finding the [[School of Magic]].

Twinsen later frees Ker'aooc, among the other wizards, from the machine in [[Dark Monk's statue]].
