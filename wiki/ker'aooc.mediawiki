== Description ==
'''Ker<nowiki>'</nowiki>aooc''' is a [[sphero]] wizard living in [[Port-Ludo]] on the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]]. He is often referred to as the '''healing wizard'''. [[Leone]] is working for him, [[Anatole]] is one of his regular customers.

== Role in Twinsen's adventure ==
[[Twinsen]] searched for Ker'aooc during his second adventure because he needed a cure for his [[Dino-Fly]]. However, Ker'aooc was not home. He had been invited by the [[Esmers]] to come to an exchange trip to their planet [[Zeelich]]. Leone directed Twinsen to the [[School of Magic]] instead.

Twinsen later freed Ker'aooc, among the other wizards, from the machine in [[Dark Monk's statue]].

== Trivia ==
Twisen borrowed a vial of [[Gallic Acid]] from Ker'aooc. Leone allowed him to take it.
