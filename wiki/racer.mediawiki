The '''racer''' spends all day driving his car around the race track on Desert Island. He tells [[Twinsen]] to come back once he gets a car so they can race.

Once Twinsen has access to a car on Desert Island, in case he happened to misplace it in an unreachable area and went to the Racer, he could have it waiting for him.

The Racer would ask to follow him when Twinsen got his a car. He gives an extra [[Clover Leaf]] at the finish if Twinsen managed to follow right behind him, and went all the way around the track.
