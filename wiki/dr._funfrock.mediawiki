'''Dr. FunFrock''' is the main antagonist of [[Twinsen]] and his allies. He was a rather big [[Quetch]] and the dictator of [[Twinsun]], before Twinsen stopped his influence. He later disguised himself as [[Dark Monk]], the supposedly reincarnated god of [[Zeelich]]. His main goal was to get godlike powers. He beliefed to get them from the power of [[Sendell]] and the [[Stellar Entity]] inside Twinsun.

==During "FunFrock's Reign"==
During his dictatorship, he made use of his knowledge of cloning and teleporting to ensure total control of the planet's citizens. His [[clones]] of all races could be teleported to all places of [[Twinsun]] instantly through a network of [[telepod]]s. These technologies were controlled by the [[Teleportation Center]] and the Cloning Center that was inside his [[FunFrock's Secret Fortress|secret fortress]].

He built prisons all over the planet to hold any dissidents captive, including the massive [[Citadel]], giving the name to [[Citadel Island]]. Alternately, people could be forced under house arrests, indicated by bricked up entrance doors.

He also evacuated the [[Northern Hemisphere]] in order to ensure his plans to dig a hole to the center of Twinsun starting from [[Polar Island]] in order to gain god powers. To evacuate the hemisphere, he produced mutants in his [[Mutant Factory]] to scare the citizens away.

FunFrock was the tyrant the [[Legend of Sendell]] spoke of. [[Twinsen]], as the heir the prophecy spoke of, destroys FunFrock's regime in his first adventure. He first meets FunFrock, or possibly a clone of him, inside [[FunFrock's Headquarters]] on [[Principal Island]]. However, FunFrock quickly teleports himself away via the nearby [[telepod]].

After Twinsen destroys both the [[Mutant Factory]] and the [[Teleportation Center]], he is trapped by FunFrock when trying to rescue a clone of [[Zo√©]] in [[FunFrock's Secret Fortress]]. The secret fortress was built around the [[Stone of the Serpentaion]], the last [[runic stone]] of the prophecy. After Twinsen escapes the fortress's prison, he finds the runic stone, and destroys the fortress using the power of his [[Flask of Clear Water|Clear Water]].

Twinsen faces FunFrock again on the rocky peak in the center of Polar Island. After a short battle, FunFrock falls off the rock, and Twinsen estimates he was defeated. FunFrock then sets off a clone of him, which battles Twinsen again deeper in [[Sendell's Well]].

==During "Twinsen's Odyssey"==
FunFrock himself found a way to [[Zeelich]] and made a second plan to destroy Twinsun, along with the Zeelichian [[Emperor]]. They built reactors on [[Emerald Moon]] to fire the moon towards Twinsun. FunFrock disguised himself as [[Dark Monk]], a god of Zeelich, and manipulated the [[Esmers]] to help him with his plan.

FunFrock abducts the wizards and children of Twinsun and brings them inside [[Dark Monk's statue]]. The statue itself should be the antenna to attract the power of Sendell when Twinsun explodes.

However, FunFrock is once again stopped by Twinsen in the last minute. Twinsen defeats FunFrock and several of his clones in the statue, and the Esmers destroy the lunar reactors right before the moon's impact on Twinsun.
