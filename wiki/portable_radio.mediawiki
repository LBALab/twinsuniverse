The '''portable radio''' is a device enabling contact between two people, if they are within range. The portable radio used in [[Little Big Adventure 2]] was created by [[Jerome Baldino]].

After [[Twinsen]] brings the [[car part]] to [[Zoé]], she tells him that Baldino forgot to give him the portable radio. Twinsen then goes back to [[Jerome Baldino's residence (Port-Ludo)|Baldino's house]], and receives the radio from him. As soon as Twinsen gets out of Baldino's house, Zoé calls him on the radio, telling him that she brought [[Twinsen's car|their car]] to [[Desert Island]].

Twinsen receives several other calls during the game, but it is not possible to use the radio to call others. After Twinsen retrieves [[Sendell's Ball]], Jerome Baldino calls him from [[Emerald Moon]], to tell him about the diabolical plans of the [[Esmer]]s. He also instructs Twinsen about how to reach Emerald Moon.

Later on, when arriving on [[Otringal]], Baldino contacs Twinsen several times to remind him to get the [[can of gazogem]] required for both the ship and the [[Super Jetpack]].
