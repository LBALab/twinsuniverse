**Felix** is a [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") spotted in the
[harbour](Citadel_Island_Harbour "wikilink") of [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"). During the start of [Twinsen's
Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink") he is seen fishing at the
harbour, and from time to time catching [crabs](crab "wikilink").

He lives in great fear of [The Tral端](The_Tral端 "wikilink"), the monster
of Citadel Island, that lives in a cave near the cliffs. As soon as
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") mentions the Tral端 when Felix is around,
he freaks out.

Felix is only able to give Twinsen some clues about the Tral端 or about
[Raph](Raph "wikilink"). Beating the crabs Felix catches grants Twinsen
[life candies](life_candies "wikilink") and [kashes](kashes "wikilink").

When Twinsen hits Felix, the rabbibunny drops his fishing pole, runs to
the water and dives in. He disappears from the scene, and is only back
when Twinsen re-enters the harbour.
