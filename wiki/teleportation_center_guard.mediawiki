==Description==
The entrance of the well protected [[Teleportation Center]] was guarded by a nameless, simple [[Quetch]]. His task was to ask visitors for identification and open the Center's gates for them. He was armed with a simple pistol, but when necessary he was helped by the two shooting robots behind the gates.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The Teleportation Center guard needed to give [[Twinsen]] access to the Teleportation Center. Twinsen needed to show [[Mies van der Rooh's ID card]] in order to get entrance to the building. Though the guard did not recognize Twinsen, he would have attacked him in case Twinsen had used [[Twinsen's ID Card|his own ID card]].
