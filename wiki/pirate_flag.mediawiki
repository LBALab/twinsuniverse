The '''pirate flag''' is an emblem used by the [[rabbibunnies]] [[rebels|rebelling]] against [[FunFrock]] as a sign of trustworthiness. Whoever wishes to show his good wills, must carry a pirate flag on his ship's mast. Without this flag, anyone who dares approaching the island is encountered by a fusillade from the rebels, eventually scaring him away. However, carrying this flag on a ship is highly approved by the rebels, who realize the good wills of the visitor.

If Twinsen attempts reaching Rebellion Island without a pirate flag on his [[catamaran]], the rebels start shooting towards his ship, and Twinsen escapes to the [[Hamalayi Mountains]]. There, he meets another rebel, who tells him that he must retrieve a pirate flag if he wishes to reach Rebellion Island.

Following the rebel's advice, when robbing the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxima Island]], Twinsen steals a pirate flag, which he later hangs upon his catamaran. Once having the flag on, Twinsen is able to safely reach Rebellion Island, and join the rebels there.
