'''Rick''' is a [[sup]] owning [[Rick's Café]] at the [[Otringal harbour|harbour]] of [[Otringal]]. He is also the head of the underworld in Otringal. Rick is considerably larger than any other sup seen in the game.

When searching for a way to access [[Island CX]], [[Twinsen]] talks with a [[franco]] on the [[Island of the Celebration]], who tells him that the only ones who might be able to help him are Rick and his gang. Twinsen then goes to Rick's Café, where he finds out that Rick's office is well guarded by heavily sizes [[wannies]]. Twinsen has two ways to enter Rick's office: either by killing his body guards until one of them leaves behind a [[key]] to the office, or by going through the backstage of the café.

In his office, Twinsen tells Rick about [[Twinsun]] being endangerd by the plans of the [[Emperor]]. Rick reveals that he is unable to help Twinsen, and sends him to talk with [[Johnny Rocket]] at the [[Imperial Hotel]].
