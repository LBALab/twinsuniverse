==Description==
'''Gazogem''' is refined by the [[Francos]] at the [[Gazogem Refinery]], using [[gems]] mined by the [[Wannies]] in the [[Undergas]]. The fuel is sold in the [[Otringal]] [[gas station]], and delivered to the other Zeelichian islands by tankers.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
After leaving [[Emerald Moon]], [[Baldino]] and [[Twinsen]] crashed on a small isle of Otringal. Jerome needed Gazogem to fix the spaceship, as well as to improve Twinsen's [[proto-pack]]. Twinsen had to go up to the Otringal gas station where he was told by a nearby salesman that no more of this fuel was available at the station, and that a tanker would later arrive from the [[Island of the Francos]] to refill the bunker, but would not do so for a while. For these reasons, Twinsen had to go to the Island of the Francos, and retrieve a gazogem can from the refinery. After bringing the can of gazogem to Jerome, the grobo was able to fix his space shuttle, and power up Twinsen's proto-pack to a [[super jet-pack]].

==Trivia==
It's called gazogem because it is made of gems. The French translation would be "gaz au gemmes," hence the name.
