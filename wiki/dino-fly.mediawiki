==Description==

The Dino-Fly is a mythical creature, with uncertain origins. He is a green dinosaur-like animal, with the ability to fly. When [[Twinsen]] finds him, he is told that he has been waiting for him for a long time.

==Role in Twinsen's Adventure==

The Dino-Fly is an asset to both of [[Twinsen]]'s Adventure. On his first trip around [[Twinsun]], [[Twinsen]] meets the Dino-Fly at the cliff peak of [[Tippet Island]]'s surface. At this point, the Dino-Fly is only able to fly around the [[northern hemisphere]], but in the second adventure, [[Twinsen]] has taken him to his home on [[Citadel Island]], and he can fly around the few islands that you visit on [[Twinsun]].

In both adventures, he provides a means of free transport around the planet for [[Twinsen]].
