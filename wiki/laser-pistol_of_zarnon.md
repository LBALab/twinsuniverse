The **Laser-Pistol of Zarnon**, usually referred to as **laser-pistol**
or **pisto-laser**, is a pistol loaded with [rock
crystal](rock_crystal "wikilink"). This pistol fires short, perfectly
horizontal and slow moving laser rays that explode upon impact. It
causes lots of damage, and due to the horizontal rays it has a very long
range. However, it reloads very slowly.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") receives the laser pistol from the
[dissidents](dissidents "wikilink") in the [Twinsunian Souvenir
Shop](Twinsunian_Souvenir_Shop "wikilink") when they help him prepare
for the journey to [Island CX](Island_CX "wikilink"). They instruct him
to load the pistol with rock crystal mined from the [Island of the
Celebration](Island_of_the_Celebration "wikilink"). Twinsen goes there,
and with a [pick-ax](pick-ax "wikilink") he buys from the [Francos
bazaar](Francos_bazaar "wikilink"), he mines the rock crystal and loads
the pistol with it.

Without the pistol, Twinsen cannot reach the levers that control the
door leading to the [Francos harbour](Francos_harbour "wikilink"), from
which he takes a tanker to the [Elevator to the
Undergas](Elevator_to_the_Undergas "wikilink").

The laser pistol also serves as an effective weapon, especially against
far away enemies.
