{{Quote|
Quote=I've been working on a Jet-Pack prototype for days now. It's a small reactor that harnesses onto your back and allows you to fly about. My problem is that my last test flight wreaked a bit of havoc on the garden wall. It is rather difficult to fine tune the motor's power. I need a rheostat like the one you find in a hair dryer. Do you think you can find one of those for me?|

{{Quote|
Quote=Well it's not a Jet-Pack yet, it's still just a Proto-Pack. I would appreciate it if you could test it out to see how it works. You should be able to fly over the water if you approach it from a gently sloping beach. But don't jump! Will you test it for 10 Kashes?|

Quote=I've been working on a Jet-Pack prototype for days now. It's a small reactor that is harnessed on the back and allows its user to fly about. My problem is that my latest flight test wreaked havoc on my Southern wall. So I'd like to borrow the rheostat in your hair dryer to fine tune the power of the motors (from looking at your hairdo, I don't think you really need the dryer, anyway). And if that works, I will have a job offer for you|

{{Quote|
Quote=So you found a hair dryer? Great! I'll be with you in a minute, just let me install the rheostat.|

Quote=Here, this is that portable radio I forgot to give you. Sorry about the mixup, but I think you'll agree it was worth waiting for!|
Character=Jerome Baldino}}
{{Quote|
Quote=I could've called it an "integrated super dynamo circuitry mechanism" but I decided to go with "portable radio". A little catchier, huh? Incidentally, I'll let you know when the Proto-Pack is ready, it'll let you fly around in complete safety.|

Quote=winsen, I am on Emerald Moon. I have uncovered a diabolical plot organized by the Esmers!! The kidnapping of the wizards and the children was only a small part of their plan. They are about to destroy our planet!!! Listen Twinsen, you must meet me!!|
