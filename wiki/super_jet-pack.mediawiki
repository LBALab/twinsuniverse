==Description==
With the [[gazogem]] as fuel, the [[Proto-Pack]] transforms into a '''Super Jet-pack'''. This enables flying higher and faster than with the proto-pack, as well as boarding from less shallow locations.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Since the elevators to the [[Upper City]] were temporarily out of order, [[Twinsen]] was not able to meet [[Johnny Rocket]] at the [[Imperial Hotel]]. The only way there was via a small river that was too high for the simple proto-pack. Fortunately enough for Twinsen, [[Jerome Baldino]] said he could improve his proto-pack with the little help of a can of gazogem. The super-jet-pack itself had no vital role thereafter, as in most places the proto-pack would have sufficed. However, Twinsen did find it handy at certain points in his adventure, for example at the [[Island of Celebration]], when making his way to the [[rock crystal]], or in the [[Island below the Celebration]], going to the [[secret mosquibee hideout]].

 |quote=Of course, but I will need this gazogem sooner or later. Besides it allows me to transform your proto-pack and increase its performance.

 |quote=Hey there, don't forget my gazogem. I really need it to repair the vessel. And I think you'll appreciate what it does to your protopack.

 |quote=Thank you, Twinsen. Now I can make a ship that can race the comets! Anyway, here's something to turn your protopack into a super jetpack. And from now on, you can fly higher.
