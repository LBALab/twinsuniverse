==Description==
With the [[gazogem]] as fuel, the [[proto-pack]] transforms into a '''super jet-pack'''. This enables flying higher and faster than with the proto-pack, as well as boarding from less shallow locations.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Since the elevators to the [[Upper City]] were temporarily out of order, [[Twinsen]] was not able to meet [[Johnny Rocket]] at the [[Imperial Hotel]]. The only way there was via a small river that was too high for the simple proto-pack. Fortunately enough for Twinsen, [[Baldino]] said he could improve his proto-pack with the little help of a can of gazogem. The super-jet-pack itself had no vital role thereafter, as in most places the proto-pack would have sufficed. However, Twinsen did find it handy at certain points in his adventure, for example at the [[Island of Celebration]], when making his way to the [[rock crystal]], or in the [[Island below the Celebration]], going to the [[secret mosquibee hideout]].
