The '''spacesuit guards''' can be found on [[Emerald Moon]], they each guard an airlock entrance. When [[Twinsen]] arrives on the Emerald Moon he needs to give the guards an operation code.
The guards are equipped with double lasers (like the [[Laser-Pistol of Zarnon]]), while Twinsen is equipped with double lasers of a different kind.
