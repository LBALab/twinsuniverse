'''Fab''' is a [[sphero]] musician. He is best friends with [[Pat]] and [[Raph]]. Just like them, he likes hanging out in [[Chez Luc]].

Talking with Fab is not a necessary part of the game, although he is able to give [[Twinsen]] a small hint about Raph's whereabouts when Twinsen is looking for him.
