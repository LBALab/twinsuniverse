'''Fab''' is a [[sphero]] musician. He is best friends with [[Pat]] and [[Raph]]. Just like them, he likes hanging out in [[Chez Luc]]. The three of them started a band and they are seen in Chez Luc wondering where their buddy, Raph has dissappeared to. Fab does hint to [[Twinsen]] as to the location of where Raph is usually seen practicing his guitar.
