'''Bersimon''', often referred to as '''The Weather Wizard''' is a weather wizard who lives in a [[Weather Wizard tent|tent]] on the [[cliffs]] of [[Citadel Island]]. He is a fully qualified wizard, who graduated from the [[School of Magic]].

The Weather Wizard is the only one capable of chasing the [[storm]] that prevents [[Twinsen]] from going to [[Desert Island]]. However, he has to stand at a high point in order to utter a conjuration, and the [[lighthouse]] is the only available place at the island. After Twinsen freed [[Raph]], the lighthouse keeper, Bersimon is able to stop the storm. Then, finally capable of landing, the [[Esmers]] come.

Bersimon also once hid [[Sendell's Ball]] in a cage of ice in the [[Citadel Island sewers|sewers]]. He already made a potion, which only needed a [[pearl of incandescence]] to become ready for use, for freeing the ball.
