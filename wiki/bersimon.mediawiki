'''Bersimon''', often referred to as '''The Weather Wizard''' is a weather wizard who lives in a [[Weather Wizard tent|tent]] on the [[cliffs]] of [[Citadel Island]]. He is a fully qualified wizard, who graduated from the [[School of Magic]].

The Weather Wizard spends most of his time, frantic about the missing lighthouse keeper and his boiling cauldron. He informs [[Twinsen]] that he cannot stop the storm until he gains access to the lighthouse but the lighthouse keeper is nowhere to be found.

A poster on his wall says Bersimon has reached the rank of Grand Master of sea winds and tornadoes. The Weather Wizard is thereby the only one capable of dispursing the [[storm]] that prevents [[Twinsen]] from going to [[Desert Island]]. However, he has to stand at a high point in order to utter a conjuration, and the [[lighthouse]] is the only available place at the island. After Twinsen frees [[Raph]], the lighthouse keeper, Bersimon will be able to stop the storm. Then, finally capable of landing, the [[Esmer]]s will land on the planet.

Bersimon also once hid [[Sendell's Ball]] in a cage of ice in the [[Citadel Island sewers|sewers]]. He already made a potion, which only needs a [[Pearl of Incandescence]] to become ready for use, for freeing the ball.

{{spoiler|{{list
 |After Raph is rescued, the Weather Wizard takes Twinsen and [[Zo√©]] to the top of the lighthouse and disperses the storm.
 |Later, when Twinsen seeks his advice, he's gone from his tent and leaves Twinsen a note with instructions to finish the [[Ring of Lightning|spell]] he is working on.}}}}
