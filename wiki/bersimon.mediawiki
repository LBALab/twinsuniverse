==Description==
Bersimon is the Weather Wizard who lives on the [[cliffs]] of [[Citadel Island]]. He is a fully qualified wizard, who graduated from the [[School of Magic]]. He seems to be one of the wisest people of the island.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The Weather Wizard was the only one capable of chasing the storm that prevented [[Twinsen]] from going to [[Desert Island]]. However, he had to stand at a high point in order to utter a conjuration, and the [[lighthouse]] was the only available place at the island. After Twinsen freed [[Raph]], the lighthouse keeper, Bersimon was able to stop the storm. Then, finally capable of landing, the [[Esmers]] came. The Weather Wizard also once hid [[Sendell's Ball]] in a cage of ice in the [[sewers]]. He already made a potion, which only needed a [[pearl of incandescence]] to become ready for use, for freeing the ball.

Quote=This storm...I wanted to get rid of it but the lighthouse was closed and I can't find the keeper anywhere. Only he could help me reach the top of the building where I have the view I need to utter a conjuration. It's the only way to stop this storm that neutralizes the island. But I need the lighthouse keeper.|
