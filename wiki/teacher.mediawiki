 |[Sniff]...the children...we were at the "Flowers Circle" [sniff]...suddenly one of those alien ships showed up right overhead. There was this big white flash, and then...nothing. Next thing I remember, I found myself alone, the children nowhere in sight, and the ship was taking off. It's horrible, Mr. Twinsen! You have to find them! You have to!

==Description==
The school '''Teacher''' on [[Citadel Island]] during [[Twinsen's Odyssey]] plays no vital role except that she recalls to [[Twinsen]] the abduction of the children of [[Twinsun]]. Twinsen must then continue his quest to look for them.

She is the teacher of the four kids at the Citadel [[Schoolhouse]]. While it's raining, the teacher is stuck inside the school with the kids. After the rain clears and the sun is out, she takes the kids up to the [[Ridge of the Flowers Circle|Flowers Circle]].
