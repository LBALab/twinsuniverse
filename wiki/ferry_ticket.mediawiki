==Description==
The '''ferry ticket''' is used for travelling from one island to another around [[Twinsun]]'s [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It can be bought in shops near the islands' harbours, and once shown to the [[ferry captain]], one may board and travel to another island.

The ticket is coloured red and yellow, with the letters IIF on it, standing for Inter-Island Ferries.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
During his two adventures, [[Twinsen]] had to travel from island to island a lot. Until buying the catamaran, or finding/healing [[Dino-Fly]], his way to travel was by ferry. The cost of the ticket varied, depending on where Twinsen bought it.

At the beginning of his first adventure, Twinsen escaped the [[citadel]], and therefore when he spoke to the ticket seller, the latter called a [[grobo clone]]. The only way Twinsen could recieve a ticket then was to complete a sokoban-like puzzle for a sailor [[grobo]], who in return gave Twinsen a counterfeit ticket.

In case Twinsen happened to have a ticket with him when arriving on [[Zeelich]], he could sell it at the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]].
