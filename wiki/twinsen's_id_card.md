## Description

**Twinsen's ID Card** is basically a normal ID card, with
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink")'s deatils written on it. It was taken from
him when he was arrested and thrown into the
[Citadel](Citadel "wikilink"). This card allowed Twinsen to identify
himself to authority figures, but given the facts that he was an escapee
from the Citadel, and that [Dr. FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink")
wanted him dead, it was usually better to keep the card to himself.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

The ID card did not play a role in Twinsen's adventure, but the
[quetch](quetch "wikilink") was able to show this card to several
inhabitants of the planet. In many cases, this resulted in him being in
danger, as some people recognized his photo on the ID card from the
Wanted posters around the planet, thus sounding the alrm to call a
nearby [clone](clone "wikilink").
