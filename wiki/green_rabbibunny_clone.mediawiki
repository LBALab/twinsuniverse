Green Rabbibunny Clones hold a control box, which upon sighting an enemy, kneel down and enter buttons on the control box, which then makes them shoot multiple bullets.
A common Green Rabbibunny Clone Twinsen has to encounter is the one in the [[Military Camp]] on [[Principal Island]] as he goes back and forth from [[Port Belooga]] to the [[Old Burg]]
