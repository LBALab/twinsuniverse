'''Green [[Rabbibunny]] [[Clone]]s''' hold a control box, which upon sighting an enemy, kneel down and enter buttons on the control box, which then makes them shoot multiple bullets.

A common Green Rabbibunny Clone [[Twinsen]] has to encounter is the one in the [[Military Camp]] on [[Principal Island]], as he goes back and forth from [[Port Belooga]] to the [[Old Burg]].
