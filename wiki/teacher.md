## Description

The school **Teacher** on [Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink")
during [Twinsen's Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink") plays no vital
role except that she recalls to [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") the
abduction of the children of [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"). Twinsen must
then continue his quest to look for them.

She is the teacher of the four kids at the Citadel
[Schoolhouse](Schoolhouse "wikilink"). While it's raining, the teacher
is stuck inside the school with the kids. After the rain clears and the
sun is out, she takes the kids up to the [Flowers
Circle](Ridge_of_the_Flowers_Circle "wikilink").
