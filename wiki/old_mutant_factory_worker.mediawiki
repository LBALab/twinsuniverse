Quote=From this warehouse we send material to the other hemisphere, we use a shuttle that dates back to the old subway lines. I participated in its construction but I've been waiting for a ferry for two years... Two years!!|

Not much is known about this character from LBA1. He is an ex-worker of the [[Mutant Factory]] waiting outside the factory for a ferry home, and has apparently been doing so for two years.
