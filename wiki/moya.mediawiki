==Description==
'''Moya''' is a turtle residing inside the sea, mainly around the [[oasis]]. She is rather kind, and is willing to come and take people somewhere whenever they ring the bell.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
When Twinsen rang the bells that stand near the oasis or at the left side of the [[Desert Island harbour|harbour]], Moya came and invited him to jump on her back to go somewhere. At the oasis, she brought Twinsen to a rock in the water where he could find a [[clover box]]. When Twinsen rang the bell near the harbour, she brought him to the [[Cave of the Pearl of Incandescence]].

Quote=Hi Twinsen. If you want to see Moya the turtle, you may find her at the small oasis or on the other side of the harbor. To call her, just ring the bell.|
