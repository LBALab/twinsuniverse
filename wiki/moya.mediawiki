'''Moya''' is a turtle residing inside the sea surrounding the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]]. She is mostly seen around the southern beach of the island, either near the [[oasis]] or near the west side of [[Port-Ludo]]. Moya is willing to take people on her back for sea trips. To use her services, one should ring the bells located near either of those two places.

When [[Twinsen]] rings these bells, Moya comes and invites him to jump on her back to go somewhere. At the oasis, she brings Twinsen to a rock in the water where he can find a [[clover box]]. Near the harbour, she brings him to the [[Cave of the Pearl of Incandescence]].
