Age=Adult}}

'''Patrick''' is a [[Gloum]] who welcomes the winners of the key to the Super Jackpot chamber in the [[Otringal]] [[Casino]]. He acts nice, but is actually the same as all other Gloums- an agressive fraud.

When [[Twinsen]] enters the Super Jackpot chamber at the casino, Patrick instructs him about spinning the wheel. Once Twinsen gives the wheel a spin, another Gloum comes down from above, and with Patrick, they start hitting Twinsen and rob him of all his money. Killing Patrick and the other Gloum pays well- 50 [[Zlito]]s from each of them, plus the [[key]] to the door to the outside.
