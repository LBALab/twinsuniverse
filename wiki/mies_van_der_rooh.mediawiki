'''Mies van der Rooh''' is [[Twinsen]]'s neighbour during [[FunFrock]]'s reign. He lives with his [[Mies van der Rooh's father|father]] in a [[Van der Rooh's residence|house]] in [[Bug Street]]. Mies is an architect, and works on maintaining some of FunFrock's buildings, including the [[Teleportation Center]]. He is very loyal to FunFrock, and can't see the tyranny that FunFrock causes, because he is one of the citizens who are better off during FunFrock's reign.

Mies van der Rooh was probably named after [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mies_van_der_rohe Ludwig Mies van der Rohe], a famous architect himself.

Twinsen goes to meet Mies van der Rooh after he finds a note from him in a safe in [[FunFrock's headquarters]]. Twinsen tells him that he is searching for the plans of the Teleportation Center, and Mies gives him his [[architect's pass]], which Twinsen uses to enter the building.

Some time between the events of the two games, Mies van der Rooh died under unknown circumstances. Before his death, he rebuilt the [[Citadel Island sewers|sewers system]] of [[Citadel Island]].
