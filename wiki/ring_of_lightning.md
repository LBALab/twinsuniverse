The **Ring of Lightning** is a magical ring which possesses the ability
to kill all enemies visible in sight. The magic level of this ring
upgrades together with its owner's magic level. Accordingly, enemies
stronger than the magic level at the time of using the ring do not die
from this spell.

The lightning ring consumes a great amount of magic. It requires the
[magic points](magic_points "wikilink") to be at maximum, and consumes
all of them when used.

When consulting the [Rector of the School of
Magic](Rector_of_the_School_of_Magic "wikilink") about finding the
kidnapped children, [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") learns from him that
he needs Sendell's Ball in order to upgrade his powers. For that, he
needs the Ring of Lightning to release the ball from the ice cage where
it is locked. The rector tells him that to achieve this ring, he needs a
[Pearl of Incandescence](Pearl_of_Incandescence "wikilink").

After finding such a pearl in a
[cave](cave_of_the_pearl_of_incandescence "wikilink") in [Desert
Island](Desert_Island "wikilink"), Twinsen drops the pearl in a cauldron
in [Bersimon](Bersimon "wikilink")'s [Bersimon's
tent](Bersimon's_tent "wikilink"). By doing that, Twinsen creates the
Ring of Lightning, and can then use it to trrieve Sendell's Ball, which
upgrades his magic level to Red.

Twinsen can use the Ring of Lightning in the rest of his adventure,
especially to cross heavily guarded places which are difficult to pass.
