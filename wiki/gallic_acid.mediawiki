==Description==
At this flask, '''Gallic Acid''' is stored. It is a type of acid used to restore ancient documents.  The bottle is very colourful, coloured yellow, blue and red.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
After receiving the bottle from [[Leone]], [[Twinsen]] gave the flask with the gallic acid to [[Mies van der Rooh's father|his elderly neighbour]] on [[Citadel Island]]. The neighbour used it to restore an ancient map of the [[Citadel Island sewers|Citadel Island sewer system]], which revealed that the [[pyramid-shaped key]], which he then gave to Twinsen, could be used to open the secret door to a room in which the Weather Wizard [[Bersimon]] concealed [[Sendell's Ball]] in an icy case.

==Trivia==
Shortly after he received the bottle from Leone, Twinsen gave a short visit to the nearby [[Port-Ludo bazaar|bazaar]], where he also found such a bottle- for the prize of 50 [[kashes]].

==Unconfirmed theories==
The [[racer]] at the [[White Leaf Desert]] told Twinsen a rumour after winning the race, telling that Gallic Acid might be used for speeding up cars. Twinsen was not able to do this though, and neither did the racer have any proof of that.

Quote=Here we have a very instructive map of the sewers. Before you can consult it, you must wait until I restore it. For that, I need a vial of gallic acid. Unfortunately, there's none left on the island.|
