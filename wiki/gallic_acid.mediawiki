The '''Flask with Gallic Acid''' is a flask containing gallic acid, which is used to restore ancient documents. This bottle is coloured yellow, blue and red.

Twinsen first hears about gallic acid from [[Mies van der Rooh's father|his elderly neighbour]], when he tells him he needs such acid in order to restore a map of the [[Citadel Island sewers]]. He also tells him that none is left on the island. Twinsen can get the acid from either [[Ker'aooc]]'s [[Ker'aooc's house|house]] in [[Port Ludo]], or from the narby [[Port Ludo bazaar|bazaar]] for 50 [[kashes]]. After Twinsen's neighbour receives the acid, he uses it to restore the map, which reveals a [[pyramid-shaped key]]. He then gives the key to Twinsen, who later uses it to enter the room in the sewers where [[Sendell's Ball]] is concealed in an icy cage.

Additionally, Twinsen learns from the [[racer]] in [[Von Kournil Tour]] that it is possible to boost his [[Twinsen's car|car]] with gallic acid, although this does not appear in the game.
