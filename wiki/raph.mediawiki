==Description==
'''Raph''' is the [[lighthouse]] keeper, but he would rather do other things aside from his work. He plays a guitar in the band that he, [[Pat]] and [[Fab]], his friends, together form. Raph also loves to hang out at "[[Chez Luc]]". The [[pharmacist (rabbibunny)|pharmacist]] on [[Lupin-Burg]] is his older sister.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Raph was missing, and since he was needed to chase away the storm, [[Twinsen]] went to seek him out. Putting all the hints that he received during the course of his mission together, he discovered a [[Tralü's cave|cave]] in which Raph was found imprisoned. Raph told Twinsen the [[Tralü]], a cave monster, kidnapped him, and that in order for him to escape, the quetch has to free him. Twinsen, being the hero and all, saved him from the wrath of Tralü, which gave [[Bersimon]], a local weather wizard, access to the lighthouse where he was able to disintegrate the storm.
