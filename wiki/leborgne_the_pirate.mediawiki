==Description==

LeBorgne was a ruthless pirate who roamed the entire [[southern hemisphere]] a couple of hundred years ago. He is known for killing [[Hégésippe]], an ancestor of [[Twinsen]]. His treasure of which the location was for long unknown, can these days be seen at the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxima Island]].

===Origin of name===

"LeBorgne" is not his real name, which remains unknown. The nickname LeBorgne as everyone knows him by, is translated as "The One-eyed", which is explained by the following entry from the book about LeBorgne at the Principal Island [[library]].
{{Quote|
Quote=That was his nickname because he was always chewing an old toothpick. One day, during a typhoon, he sneezed: he found his toothpick, but lost an eye!|

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

When Twinsen found out he is the current Heir, he had to retrieve the items and information left for him by his ancestors in the room underneath his house on Citadel Island. The key to this room however had been lost for presumably a few generations. The last family member to have possession of this key was Hégésippe. He was killed by LeBorgne, and the key was stolen and kept with his other treasures. To sum it up, Twinsen had to find LeBorgne's treasure to gain entry to the secret room.


==Additional quotes==

{{Quote|
Quote="This room contains information and weapons that were amassed for generations to help the Heir who will, one day, be chosen from our descendants. The key to the room was passed down from generation to generation, but our ancestor Hégésippe was the last family member to retain the key. He was attacked and killed by the ruthless pirate LeBorgne during a sea voyage. Nobody knows where Leborgne's treasure, which undoubtedly contains the golden key to the room, is today."|

Quote="To find Captain LeBorgne's treasure, the voyager who arrives at the port of Proxima island must use the closest mooring post as a guide. With his back to the docked boats, he must follow these instructions in DISCREET mode: 6 steps to the North (straight ahead), then 6 steps to the East (to his right), following the gradual slope. 2 steps to the North (straight ahead) until he reaches the metal garbage can, 3 steps to the East (to his right) until he arrives at a light post. He must stand EXACTLY between the 2 lamp posts, and then take 8 steps to the North until he arrives at a gate. Captain LeBorgne's treasure is in the building behind the gate."|
