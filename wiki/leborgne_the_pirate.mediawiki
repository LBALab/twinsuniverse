==Description==

LeBorgne was a ruthless pirate who roamed the entire [[southern hemisphere]] a couple of hundred years ago. He is known for killing [[Hégésippe]], an ancestor of [[Twinsen]]. His treasure of which the location was for long unknown, can these days be seen at the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxima Island]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

When Twinsen found out he is the current Heir, he had to retrieve the items and information left for him by his ancestors in the room underneath his house on Citadel Island. The key to this room however had been lost for presumably a few generations. The last family member to have possession of this key was Hégésippe. He was killed by LeBorgne, and the key was stolen and kept with his other treasures. To sum it up, Twinsen had to find LeBorgne's treasure to gain entry to the secret room.
