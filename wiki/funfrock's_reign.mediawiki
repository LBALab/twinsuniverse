==Background==
(the story up to Twinsen getting arrested)

==The Southern Hemisphere==

===Escape from the Citadel===
{{Quote|
Quote=Stop squirming, prisoner Twinsen!|
Character=Nurse}}
Twinsen woke up in a small prison cell inside the [[Citadel]]. By drawing the attention of the [[quetch]] [[nurse]] who guards the jail cells, he managed to get close enough to the nurse to beat him up, and escape from cell using the his elevator. Twinsen then managed to kill a [[doctor]], just before he could reach the alarm button, which would summon a [[Super-Grobo clone]] who would capture Twinsen and put him back in his cell.

Exploring the facility for a bit (and killing a few other doctors who got in his), Twinsen was able to find a [[nurse's uniform]]. This disguise helped him get close enough to one of the doctors, so he could kill him before the doctor sounded the alarm.

After escaping from the Citadel, Twinsen faced another obstacle - the exit was guarded by a [[quetch soldier]]. Silently and carefully, Twinsen was able to sneak behind the soldier, and hid in a pile of garbage. When a [[garbage truck]] finally came by, Twinsen seized the opportunity to hop on the truck, thus escaping the eyes of the guard, and the Citadel.

===Searching for Zoé===
{{Quote|
Quote=I'm looking for a young girl. She is being escorted by two groboclones.|
Character=Twinsen}}
Quickly, Twinsen ran across [[Citadel Island]], carefully avoiding several [[clones]] who were guarding the path, and looking after him. Finally, he reached [[Twinsen's house|his house]], where he was reunited with his girlfriend, [[Zoé]], but not for long... While Twinsen was hiding from the clones inside his home, a pair of [[Grobo clone]]s came to search for him. When they couldn't find him, they took arrested Zoé, possibly so that Twinsen would come looking for her.

Twinsen left his house to search for Zoé, but remembered to take the [[Magic Ball]] and the [[Ancestral Tunic]] left by his ancestors, as they would undoubtedly help him fight the clones. While exploring Citadel Island, and asking people about Zoé, Twinsen ran into an old "friend" of his - the local [[Pharmacist (Quetch)|pharmacist]]. The pharmacist was quite scared when he saw Twinsen out of prison, as he was possibly the one to inform the authorities about Twinsen's dreams. In response to seeing Twinsen, he tried to raise the alarm, which forced Twinsen to kill him and the clone who came to arrest him. Seizing the opportunity, Twinsen also searched the [[pharmacy]] for any useful items, only to find a [[bottle of cherry syrup]], and some [[kashes]]. 

Eventually, Twinsen found a [[grobo]] in [[Chez Luc]], who told him (in exchange for a drink) that he had seen Zoé and the grobos heading to [[Citadel Island Harbour|the port]]. Twinsen went to the port, and requested a [[ferry ticket]] - only to be recognized as an escapee, causing the ticket seller to sound the alarm. He quickly ran out, and found a rather disgruntled grobo sailor. The sailor was upset with his job, and offered Twinsen a ticket, if Twinsen could help him arrange the boxes in the [[warehouse]], [[wikipedia:Sokoban|Sokoban]] style. Of course, Twinsen agreed, and performed the job perfectly.
