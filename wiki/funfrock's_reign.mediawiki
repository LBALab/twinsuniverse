==Background==
(the story up to Twinsen getting arrested)

==The Southern Hemisphere==

===Escape from the Citadel===
Twinsen woke up in a small prison cell inside the [[Citadel]]. By drawing the attention of the [[quetch]] [[nurse]] who guards the jail cells, he managed to get close enough to the nurse to beat him up, and escape from cell using the his elevator. Twinsen then managed to kill a [[doctor]], just before he could reach the alarm button, which would summon a [[Super-Grobo clone]] who would capture Twinsen and put him back in his cell.

Exploring the facility for a bit (and killing a few other doctors who got in his), Twinsen was able to find a [[nurse's uniform]]. This disguise helped him get close enough to one of the doctors, so he could kill him before the doctor sounded the alarm.

After escaping from the Citadel, Twinsen faced another obstacle - the exit was guarded by a [[quetch soldier]]. Silently and carefully, Twinsen was able to sneak behind the soldier, and hid in a pile of garbage. When a [[garbage truck]] finally came by, Twinsen seized the opportunity to hop on the truck, thus escaping the eyes of the guard, and the Citadel.

Quickly but carefully, Twinsen ran across [[Citadel Island]], in order to reach his [[Twinsen's house|house]].
