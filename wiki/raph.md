**Raph** is a [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") working as the
[lighthouse](lighthouse "wikilink") keeper on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink").

Raph plays a guitar in a band together with his friends,
[Pat](Pat "wikilink") and [Fab](Fab "wikilink"). They all hang out
together at [Chez Luc](Chez_Luc "wikilink") often. Raph is the brother
of the [pharmacist](Pharmacist_(Rabbibunny) "wikilink"), and the fiancé
of [a rabbibunny](Raph's_Fiancée "wikilink").

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") searches for a way to stop the
[storm](storm "wikilink"), he learns from the [weather
wizard](weather_wizard "wikilink") that he can stop the storm from the
top of the lighthouse, which he cannot enter since Raph, the lighthouse
keeper, is missing. Twinsen can then go and ask everyone on the island
whether they have seen him, and most people hint him that Raph likes to
play his guitar on the [cliffs](cliffs "wikilink") of Citadel Island.

Twinsen eventually reaches the [Tralü's cave](Tralü's_cave "wikilink"),
where he finds Raph imprisoned by the [Tralü](Tralü "wikilink"). Raph,
afraid that the Tralü is planning to eat him, begs Twinsen to free him.
After defeating the Tralü, Twinsen reaches Raph's cell, and opens it to
free him.

Together with [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink"), Twinsen then goes to the
lighthouse, which Raph now opens, and they witness together how Bersimon
stops the storm. After the storm is over, Raph can be seen on top of the
lighthouse with his fiancée.
