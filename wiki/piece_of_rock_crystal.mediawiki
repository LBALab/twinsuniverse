==Description==
The '''rock crystal''' is a mineral used to operate [[Laser Pistol|laser pistols]]. This is a rather rare element, and can mainly be found in the northern part of the [[Island of Celebration]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In order to reach the [[Under-Gas]], [[Twinsen]] first had to go to the [[Francos Harbour]], from which he would take a ship that should bring him to the [[elevator to the Under-Gas]]. However, since the lifts that control the openning of the doors were too far to reach with the [[magic ball]], Twinsen needed a powerful weapon, such as the laser pistol.

However, the Laser Pistol can not operate until it is loaded with rock crystal. Following the advice of the Dissidents, Twinsen went to Celebration Island, where such crystal can usually be found. After circling the whole island, passing dangerous obstacles and escaping deadly lava balls, Twinsen eventually made his way to the place where rock crystal could be found. Once digging there using his [[pick-ax]], he obtained the rock crystal he needed, and was then able to his pistol, and carry on in his quest.
