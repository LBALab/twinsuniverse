Quote=Noble stranger, we will open the Door of the Sacred Carrot for you if you sabotage the mutant factory, from where the monsters that infest this hemisphere emerge. This door leads to the shore, and from there you can access all of this part of the planet..|

==Description==

The [[Rabbibunny Village Chieftain]] is a minor character in LBA1 who lives in the [[Rabbibunny Village]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

When [[Twinsen]] first enters the [[Rabbibunny Village]] he can see only one or two villagers, and mutants running around attacking them. When Twinsen goes to the center of the villlage, near a cooking pot, the [[Rabbibunny Village Chieftain]] then emerges from one of the little mud houses.

The [[Rabbibunny Village Chieftain]] opens the Door of the [[Sacred Carrot]] for [[Twinsen]] so can access the [[Northern Hemisphere]] of [Twinsun]], when Twinsen destroys the [[Mutant Factory]] and the eggs of the mutants, making the [[Rabbibunny Village]] no longer infested.
