The '''[[Rabbibunny Village Chieftain]]''' is a minor character in [[LBA 1]] who lives in the [[Rabbibunny Village]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

When [[Twinsen]] first enters the [[Rabbibunny Village]], he can see only one or two villagers, and [[mutants]] running around attacking them. When Twinsen goes to the center of the villlage, near a cooking pot, and the chieftain then emerges from one of the little mud houses.

As the Rabbibunny Village is infested by mutants from the [[mutants factory]], Twinsen goes there on their request to destroy it. After doing so, the chieftain opens the Door of the [[Sacred Carrot]] for him, which enables him access to the [[Northern Hemisphere]] of [[Twinsun]].
