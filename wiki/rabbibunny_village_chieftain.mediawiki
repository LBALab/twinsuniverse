 |Noble stranger, we will open the Door of the Sacred Carrot for you if you sabotage the mutant factory, from where the monsters that infest this hemisphere emerge. This door leads to the shore, and from there you can access all of this part of the planet..

==Description==

The '''[[Rabbibunny Village Chieftain]]''' is a minor character in [[LBA 1]] who lives in the [[Rabbibunny Village]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]].

When [[Twinsen]] first enters the [[Rabbibunny Village]], he can see only one or two villagers, and [[mutants]] running around attacking them. When Twinsen goes to the center of the villlage, near a cooking pot, and the chieftain then emerges from one of the little mud houses.

As the Rabbibunny Village is infested by mutants from the [[mutants factory]], Twinsen goes there on their request to destroy it. After doing so, the chieftain opens the Door of the [[Sacred Carrot]] for him, which enables him access to the [[Northern Hemisphere]] of [[Twinsun]].
