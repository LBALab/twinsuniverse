'''Hégésippe''' was an ancestor of [[Twinsen]]. He was the last to hold the [[key to the Heir's room]], before he was killed by the pirate [[LeBorgne]]. This story is scribes on runes at a cave near [[Twinsen's house]].

Twinsen finds the lost key in LeBorgne's treasure in the [[Maritime Museum]] on [[Proxima Island]], and uses it to enter the locked room in the cave.
