The '''drunk rabbibunny''' is a nameless [[rabbibunny]] who sits in [[Chez Luc]] at the beginning of [[Little Big Adventure 2]]. The rabbibunny is injured, because he once fell down the hall in the pub's cellar.

[[Twinsen]] does not have to talk to this rabbibunny, but he can receive from him a clue about the hole in cellar, leading down to the [[Citadel Island sewers|sewers]], where Twinsen finds [[Sendell's Ball]].
