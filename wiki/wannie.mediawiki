Quote=Wannie representative. The race of the Wannies lives in the under-gas. They are the workers of the gem mine, from which gazogem is made. The mine is being run by the Building Company, under imperial supervision.|

Kind of big moles who stand on two feet.. They live in families in comfortably furnished caves. Their favorite place is the under-gas because they can't survive on the surface without protecting themselves against the light (with sunglasses, big black capes, etc.). Traditionally miners from generation to generation, they sift the under-gas lava to extract gems for the Building Company which, in exchange, protects them from the monsters.
