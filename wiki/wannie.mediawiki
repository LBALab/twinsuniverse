Kind of big moles who stand on two feet. They live in families in comfortably furnished caves. Their favorite place is the [[under-gas]] because they can't survive on the surface without protecting themselves against the light (with sunglasses, big black capes, etc.). Traditionally miners from generation to generation, they sift the under-gas lava to extract gems for the [[Building Company]] which, in exchange, protects them from the monsters.
