'''Mosquibee''' is one of the four main species of the planet [[Zeelich]]. Their name is derived from a combination of ''mosquito'' and ''bee''. With their wings, they are the only race in Zeelich capable of flying.

The mosquibees usually keep to themselves, and outside the [[Island of the Mosquibees]] in the [[Under-Gas]] of Zeelich, they are hardly seen around the planet. A plaque in [[Dark Monk's temple]] describes them as such:

{{Quote
 |quote=Mosquibee representative. The race of the Mosquibees lives in the under-gas. Their village is a magnificent cocoon anchored on the rocky tor which supports the island CX.
 |character=A plaque at Dark Monk's temple}}

When the [[Emperor]] assisted [[FunFrock]] in imposing as [[Dark Monk]], the mosquibees are the only ones in the planet who resist the Emperor's actions. Instead, they have their own queen, [[Astrid]].

[[Twinsen]] comes to the Island of the Mosquibees knowing it provides access to [[Island CX]]. Just after he proves his trustworthiness to the queen, the Emperor's soldiers attack the village, and a battle commences between them and the mosquibees. Several mosquibees take hide then in [[mosquibees hideout|a cave]] in [[Volcano Island]].
