These insectoids belong to the family of short-winged wasps. This race doesn't like to be told what to do by any outsider and lives in a swarm around its queen. The mosquibees live in an immense cocoon clinging to one of the peaks of the under-gas. Ever since they gave asylum to the dissidents from Otringal, skirmishes with the Emperor's forces are becoming more and more frequent....
