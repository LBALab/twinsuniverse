==Description==

The esmer shuttle is a flying ship used for transportations of persons and goods. It's most remarkable for being able to make inter-planetary flights, but can also be used for flights within the atmosphere of a planet.

This shuttle was developed by and is most frequently used by [[esmers]], particularly the [[sups]]. It was first spotted on [[Twinsun]] not long before the [[Esmer#The_Esmer_invasion|Esmer invasion]].

There is but one standardized model of the shuttle, allowing the use of efficient space ports, and easy maintenance and production. The [[Emperor of Zeelich]] had his own customized shuttle which was mostly the same but had a slightly more luxe interour and it beared the emperor's mark on the outside.

The esmer shuttle is the only known means of transportation between [[Zeelich]], [[Twinsun]] and the [[Emerald Moon]] next to [[Baldino's Spaceship]].

===Exteriour===

[[Image:Screenshot-lba2-movies-07-esmers_shuttle-VOYAGEZ09.gif|right]]The shuttle is shaped much like a saucer. The top of the shuttle's body with the cockpit is yellow while the bottom is coloured red. The shuttle has several flexible feet that allow for comfortable landings, but are contracted during flight. Finally there is one door in the shuttle that is lowered after landing, doubling as stairs to get inside or out.

While not frequently used, at the bottom of the shuttle are a pair of mechanical hands that can be used for carrying external transportation such as heavy loads that need to be released in-flight.

===Interiour===

Getting inside the shuttle, the passenger finds himself in the cargo hold. This is well reachable so loading and unloading is easy. It's mostly empty apart for a storage room for space suits which can be found in all shuttles.

At the top of the shuttle, reachable by a ladder, is the passenger's lounge and shuttle controls.

===Controls===

The shuttle is usually not manually controlled, but rather flies on auto-pilot using the [[Itinerary Token]]. This token has to be retrieved from the respective control tower before take-off and has the flight pattern programmed in it. The passenger simply has to insert it into the designated slot in the shuttle's cockpit to start the flight, after which he may sit back comfortably.
