==Description==
Bruce resides in a tent near the shore in an uninhabited area of the [[White Leaf Desert]]. He seems to like nothing but playing his guitar the whole day.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Like most characters, Bruce had no role in [[Twinsen]]'s adventure, except absent mindedly giving clues. In this case, he told Twinsen that there are still some treasures buried in the [[Temple of Bù]].

==Trivia==
Once the [[Esmers]] invaded the planet, Bruce has disappeared, and was never seen neither heard from again.
