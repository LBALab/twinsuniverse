'''The Ferryman's Song''' is a song used for calling [[The Ferryman]] in the [[Undergas]] of [[Zeelich]].

The lyrics of the song are as follows:
{{Quote|
Quote=Ferryman if you please,<br>
Take me across the raging seas,<br>
For a few gems, I take your boat,<br>
I cannot swim, I cannot float!!|
Character=The Ferryman's Song}}

[[Twinsen]] learns this song from [[Annie]], who tells him to sing it at [[Ferryman's lane]] in order to call the ferryman. After doing so, the ferryman arrives and takes Twinsen on his ferry. Twinsen later uses the song to call the ferryman in the [[Island of the Mosquibees]] and in [[Volcano Island]].
