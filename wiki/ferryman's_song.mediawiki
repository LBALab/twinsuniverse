The '''Ferryman's Song''' is a song used for calling [[The Ferryman]] in the [[Undergas]] of [[Zeelich]].

The lyrics of the song are as follows:
{{Quote
 |Ferryman if you please, take me across the raging seas, for a few gems, I take your boat, I cannot swim, I cannot float!!
 |character=Twinsen
 |singing the Ferryman's Song at the Ferryman's Pier
 |island=Island of the Wannies
 |planet=undergas
 |quoteid=2287}}

[[Twinsen]] learns this song from [[Annie]], who tells him to sing it at [[Ferryman's lane]] in order to call the ferryman. After doing so, the ferryman arrives and takes Twinsen on his ferry. Twinsen later uses the song to call the ferryman in the [[Island of the Mosquibees]] and in [[Volcano Island]].
