==Description==
'''Fish-Bulls''' are dog-like creatures from [[Zeelich]]. They bite everything that moves. Fish-Bulls can be seen black or brown.

They are used as fighting dogs by the [[Emperor]]'s forces. There is a [[training course]] for them in the [[lower city]] of [[Otringal]]. They also can be found inside the [[Emperor's palace]], in the [[Gazogem Refinery]] and in the [[Wannies]]' [[mines]]. They were also brought to [[Twinsun]] by the [[Esmers]], where they sometimes can be seen with muzzles. However, they went freely around in the [[White Leaf Desert]], and during the Esmer invasion at several places on [[Citadel Island]] and inside the Turkish bath of the [[Hacienda del Monte-Pelado]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]] had to get past the dogs several times during his second adventure, for example at the entrance of the [[Temple of BÃ¹]] when it was taken over by the [[Esmers]]. However, the Fish-Bulls were not a big threat to him.

==Trivia==
When stepping into a Fish-Bull's crap, Twinsen was able to find a [[clover leaf]].
