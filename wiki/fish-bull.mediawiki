'''Fish-Bulls''' are dog-like creatures from [[Zeelich]]. They bite everything that moves. Fish-Bulls can be seen black or brown. Some are well behaved and wear muzzles while standing near their owner, while others are violent and will attack [[Twinsen]] as soon as he gets too close.

These creatures are used as fighting dogs by the [[Emperor]]'s forces. There is a [[training course]] for them in the [[lower city]] of [[Otringal]]. They can also be found inside the [[Emperor's Palace]], in the [[Gazogem Refinery]] and in the [[Wannie Mines]]. They are also brought to [[Twinsun]] by the [[Esmer]]s, where they sometimes can be seen with muzzles. However, they go freely around in the [[White Leaf Desert]], and during the [[Esmer invasion]] at several places on [[Citadel Island]] and inside the Turkish bath of the [[Hacienda del Monte-Pelado]].

Twinsen has to get past these dogs several times during [[Twinsen's Odyssey]], for example at the entrance of the [[Temple of BÃ¹]] when it is taken over by the [[Esmer]]s. However, the Fish-Bulls are not a big threat to him.

When stepping into a Fish-Bull's crap in the Gaozgem Refinery, Twinsen is able to find a [[clover leaf]].
