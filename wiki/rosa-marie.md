**Rosa-Marie** is a cow eating grass on the [cliffs](cliffs "wikilink")
of [Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), near the [Ruins of the
Old Citadel](Ruins_of_the_Old_Citadel "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") can ask Rosa-Marie whether she has seen
[Raph](Raph "wikilink"), the [lighthouse](lighthouse "wikilink") keeper,
and she replies she saw him with his guitar, heading to the cliffs.
Later, when the [esmers](esmer "wikilink") land on
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"), Rosa-Marie warns Twinsen that one armed
[sup](sup "wikilink") is hiding behind the trees.

If Twinsen goes behind Rosa-Marie and paces forward for a while, he gets
a [clover leaf](clover_leaf "wikilink") from her. This can be done an
unlimited number of times.
