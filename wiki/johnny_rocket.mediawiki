Quote=People from the planet Twinsun, we come to you in a spirit of peace. Thank you for dipersing this storm which prevented us from landing. We have observed your planet for many cycles now and have decided to come and study your culture on the spot. We have traveled through Space solely with the goal of discovering your civilization.|
Character=Johnny Rocket}}

==Description==
Johnny Rocket is the first ever [[Esmer]] to set foot on [[Twinsun]]. Although he helped the [[Emperor]] and [[FunFrock]] this way, he is completely against their acts and ideas and therefore helps the dissidents rebelling against them.
Johnny lives on the [[Imperial Hotel]], at the upper town of [[Otringal]]. He also seems to be the only Esmer who can speak the Twinsunian language or has a [[translator]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Johnny Rocket is the first Esmer [[Twinsen]] met. At this time, though, Johnny had no role yet. Once on [[Zeelich]], Twinsen paid Johnny Rocket a visit on [[Rick]]'s advice. Johnny then gave Twinsen the [[ring of the dissidents]], the dissidents' identification sign, and sent him to meet the dissidents at the [[Twinsunian souvenir shop]].
