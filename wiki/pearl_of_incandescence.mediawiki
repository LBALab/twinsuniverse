'''The Pearl of Incandescence''' is a pearl found in the [[Cave of the Pearl of Incandescence]] on the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]], inside a giant clam. These kind of pearls are highly prized by magicians, and enable to complete certain spells.

In order to release [[Sendell's Ball]], that was locked by [[Bersimon]] inside a frozen sphere, [[Twinsen]] has to obtain the [[Ring of Lightning]]. To do that, he needs to drop a Pearl of Incandescence into the cauldron in [[Bersimon's tent]].

The [[Rector of the School of Magic]] instructs Twinsen to get the Pearl of Incandescence from the cave in the cliffs at the Island of the White Leaf Desert. Twinsen reaches to the cave using [[Moya]]'s services, and gets the pearl using his [[proto-pack]]. He then drops the pearl in the cauldron at Bersimon's tent, which gives him the Ring of Lightning. He can then use it to release Sendell's Ball.
