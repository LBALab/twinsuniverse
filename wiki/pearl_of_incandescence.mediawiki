==Description==
'''The Pearl of Incandescence''' is a pearl found in the [[Cave of the Pearl of Incandescence]] on the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]], inside a giant clam. These kind of pearls are highly prized by magicians, and enable to complete certain spells.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In order to release [[Sendell's Ball]], that was locked inside a frozen sphere, [[Twinsen]] had to obtain the [[Ring of Lightning]]. To do that, he needed to drop a Pearl of Incandescence into [[Bersimon]]'s cauldron.

The [[Mentor of the School of Magic]] instructed the [[quetch]] to get the Pearl of Incandescence from [[Cave of the Pearl of Incandescence|the cave in the cliffs]] at the [[Island of the White Leaf Desert]]. Twinsen went to the cave, got the pearl, dropped it in the cauldron, and then travelled down the [[Citadel Island sewers|sewers]] into the room that contained Sendell's Ball, where he released it with the spell. This gave Twinsen the third level of magic: the red ball.
