==Description==
In a decent, small house at [[Peg Leg Street]], lives Beatrice, a nice female rabbibunny who apparently has no job. Very few is known about Beatrice, except that she has a friend living in the [[Old Burg]], named Julia.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Perhaps due to her not being wise enough, Beatrice was not able to tell [[Twinsen]] anything about [[Legend of Sendell|the legend]], [[Zo√©]]'s whereabouts, or [[LeBorgne]] the pirate. However, she was able to tell Twinsen about the [[clover leaf]] on the island across her house, and about him needing to fly in order to reach it.

==Additional quotes==

Quote=You know Julia? She is a nice girl. She watches a bit too much TV, but there is some truth in her story: someone left a box for clover leaves on the islet in front of my house. It is too shallow for a boat to get there by water, and since the bridge leading to the islet has collapsed, the only way to get there is to fly.|

Quote=I've got to tell you something. It's awful! My best friend (Beatrice) is in love with Steven. But Paul, Steven's half brother, left Cindy when Linda got out of the clinic after her bobsleigh accident. But not for Linda, for Tatjana! Only Serge (who secretly admires Steven) has been trying for months to win the love of Tatjana who refuses to talk to Christy since she died. All the while Stephanie - who remarried Serge - discovered the letter from Paulina in which she explained where was the box of clover leaves left behind by Roy. So, evidently, Beatrice wonders if Linda knows about the accident. You get all that?|
