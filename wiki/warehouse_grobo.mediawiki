==Description==

A grobo in the harbour of Citadel Island who sells Twinsen fake ferry tickets in LBA1, because the ticket clerk recognizes him as a wanted man. The warehouse that the Grobo is standing outside is replaced with Mr Paul's house in LBA2.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

When Twinsen needs a ferry ticket, but wont get sold one from the ticket clerk due to him being an escaped prisoner, he has to help a grobo move crates in an old warehouse, then he gets rewarded with ferry tickets. Twinsen can also buy ferry tickets off him for a small fare.
