{{spoiler|
*The Dissidents could be found in a secret room inside the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]], after Twinsen showed the [[Ring of the Dissidents]] to the salesman. After he informed Twinsen about the lunar reactor and how to reach [[Island CX]], the Wannie Dissident informed Twinsen he had a solution and handed the [[Laser-Pistol of Zarnon]]. A weapon which needs a [[Rock Crystal]] from the [[Island of the Celebration]] in order to work.
