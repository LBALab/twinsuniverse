'''Mr. Lemoine''' is a [[wannie]] working as a priest in [[Dark Monk's chapel]] at the [[Village of the Wannies]]. He is very dedicated to the case of [[Dark Monk's prophecy]], and attempts to warn anyone to not interfere with their religious ceremonies.

[[Twinsen]] goes to the chapel in a search for a way to reach the [[Mosquibees Island]]. After Mr. Lemoine warns him not to interfere with Dark Monk's ceremony, he tells Twinsen that he should consult his housemaid, [[Annie]], who knows how to reach the mosquibees.
