Quote=It's over Twinsen, you lost. To make your defeat even more bitter, I am going to tell you the truth. With all these beliefs, I was not master of my own planet, people had only ears for Dark Monk's priests!! One day, a stranger landed on Zeelich and offered to pass himself off as Dark Monk. Together, we spread the belief that he was to fulfill the great prophecy. Of course, this is far from the truth. I don't know why, but Dark Monk wants to appropriate the magical energy contained in your planet. And, since I want to become the master of Zeelich, we made a deal!!!|

Quote=Twinsunian, Dark Monk is unbeatable. In his statue, he has built a machine capable of storing the magical energy that he intends to steal from your planet!!! My agents went to Twinsun to kidnap your wizards since we needed them to attract the energy from your planet to Zeelich. But we were forced to kidnap the children because the wizards refused to cooperate!! You were our only obstacle. But now, we have won. The destruction of Twinsun and the use of the machine will intervene during the next ceremony. And you cannot prevent me from triggering the lunar reactors!!!|
