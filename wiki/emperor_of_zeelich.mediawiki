'''The Emperor of Zeelich''' is [[Dr. FunFrock]]'s right hand in his attempt to destroy [[Twinsun]] by imposing as [[Dark Monk]]. In this attempt, FunFrock spread the propaganda that Dark Monk was reincarnated.

Because the Priests of [[Zeelich]] believed that, they suspected [[Twinsen]] of stealing [[Dark Monk's key|fragments]] while he actually stole them to avoid unacceptable use of the Emperor and FunFrock. The Emperor wanted actually to be the master of Zeelich. The Emperor had overwhelming armies in comparison with the dissidents and army of [[Queen Astrid]]. He sent those armies as a way to avoid a failure of his plan.

Twinsen meets the emperor in [[Island CX]], where he kills him. Just before he dies, the emperor manages to push the button that sends the [[Emerald Moon]] towards [[Twinsun]]. After the emperor's death, Twinsen steals his [[Emperor's Sword|sword]] from the safe in the room.
