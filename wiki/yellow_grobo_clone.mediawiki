'''Yellow Grobo Clones''' were observer clones created by [[Dr. FunFrock]]. They were not capable of fighting for FunFrock, and therefore were used as normal workers, for example to keep an eye on the passengers at the [[Citadel Island harbour|Citadel Island]] and [[Principal Island harbour|Principal Island]] harbours. They are seen guarding a closed gate or [[Twinsen's house]] on [[Citadel Island]], too.

In order to get to [[Principal Island]], [[Twinsen]] has to use the [[ferry]]. The gate to the harbour, however, is blocked by a yellow grobo clone. After defeating it with his [[magic ball]], Twinsen is able to get onto the ferry.

In [[Funky Town]], [[Twinsen]] encounters a yellow grobo clone without a helmet. For a certain amount of [[Kash|money]], Twinsen bought information from the grobo clone about the plans of the [[Teleportation Center]] being in [[FunFrock's headquarters]].

Though the clones are present on other places, they are not important in the game most of the time.

A portrait of a yellow grobo clone is found in [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum]]. It has a safe hidden behind it.
