== Description ==
'''Yellow Grobo Clones''' were observer clones created by [[Dr. FunFrock]]. They were not capable of fighting for FunFrock, and therefore were used as normal workers, for example to keep an eye on the passengers at the [[Citadel Island harbour|Citadel Island]] and [[Principal Island harbour|Principal Island]] harbours. They were seen guarding a closed gate or [[Twinsen's house]] on [[Citadel Island]], too.

== Role in Twinsen's adventure ==

In order to get to [[Principal Island]], [[Twinsen]] had to use the [[ferry]]. The gate to the harbour, however, was blocked by a yellow grobo clone. After defeating it with his [[magic ball]], Twinsen was able to get onto the ferry.

Though the clones were present on other places, they were not important for Twinsen's adventure most of the time.

== Trivia ==
In [[Funky Town]], [[Twinsen]] encountered a yellow grobo clone without a helmet. For a certain amout of [[Kash|money]], one could by information from him. Twinsen himself got information from the grobo clone about the plans of the [[Teleportation Center]] being in [[FunFrock's headquarters]].

A portrait of a yellow grobo clone is found in [[Miss Bloop's Private Museum]]. It has a safe hidden behind it.
