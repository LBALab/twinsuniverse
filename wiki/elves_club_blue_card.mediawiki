The '''Elves Club Blue Card''' is a blue card coated with star powder. It is a proof that the owner is officially a part of the [[Elves]] Club. It also enables opening some gates around [[Twinsun]].

[[Twinsen]] receives the card from [[Joe the Elf]], after finding him in a labyrinth in [[Desert Island]]. The card guarantees him an entrance to the Elves Club, as the fourth member there. Later on, after finding and releasing [[Raymond the Elf]], Twinsen receives from him some [[clovers]] as gratitude when showing him the card. Twinsen also needs the card in order to open specific gates around Twinsun, especially in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]] area.
