==Description==
The '''Elves Card''' is a blue card coated with star powder. It is a proof that the owner is officially a part of the [[Elves]] Club. It also enables opening some gates around [[Twinsun]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]] received the card from [[Joe the Elf]], after finding him in a maze in [[Desert Island]]. The card guaranteed him an entrance to the Elves Club, as the fourth member there. Later on, after finding and releasing [[Raymond the Elf]], Twinsen received from the latter some [[clovers]] as gratitude. Also, Twinsen needed the card in order to open specific gates around Twinsun, especially in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]] area.

==Unconfirmed theories==
When Twinsen receives the card, the narrator said that he's officially the fourth member of the Elves Club. However, it is only known about two elves other than him: Joe and Raymond. It is unknown who the third elf is.
