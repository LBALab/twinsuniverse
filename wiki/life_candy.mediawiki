==Description==
Made to look like hearts, these '''life candies''' contain a special genetic stimulant that triggers a re-growth of any damaged part of the body. Because the stimulant gets used up as it works, each capsule only allows a slight recovery of health. As such, they are used to heal minor injuries, and generally increase a person's stamina.

Because of the cheap, widely available nature of the medicine, there is little sickness or disability on [[Twinsun]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
The life candies were used by Twinsen whenever he needed to recover health. They are one of the 3 main collectable items on Twinsun.
