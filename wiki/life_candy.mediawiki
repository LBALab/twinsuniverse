'''Life candies''' are a part of the lives system in the [[Little Big Adventure]] games. They are made to look like hearts, and contain a special genetic stimulant that triggers the regeneration of any damaged part of the body. Because the stimulant is used up as it works, each capsule only allows a slight recovery of health. As such, they are used to heal minor injuries, and generally increase a person's stamina. When a person's life points meter reaches zero, he loses one [[clover leaf]].

Because of the cheap, widely available nature of the medicine, which is found in most garbage cans and plants, there is little sickness or disability on [[Twinsun]].

The life candies are used by [[Twinsen]] whenever he needs to recover health. He can either find them in plants or garbage cans, or buy them in the bazaars around the planet. In [[Little Big Adventure 2]], as part of his studies in the [[School of Magic]], he receives the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]], which enables him storing a greater amount of life points, as well as using them to heal others.
