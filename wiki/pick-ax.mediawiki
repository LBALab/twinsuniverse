==Description==
The '''pick-ax''' is used to dig in grassy areas or to extract a piece from a hard object. It is mainly used by the [[Wannies]], to mine [[gems]]. Additionally, the [[Francos]] used them to search for their lost [[Francos fragment|fragment]]. Such axes were available at the local [[Francos bazaar|bazaar]] for 20 [[Zlitos]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In his search for the Francos Fragment, [[Twinsen]] bought a pick-ax from the bazaar at the [[Island of the Francos]]. He used it at the island in order to dig for the fragment, after finding it following the instructions on the [[Burgermaster's notes]].

The second time Twinsen needed the pick-ax, was after the Dissidents awarded him with a [[Laser Pistol]]. For the pistol to work, Twinsen needed find [[rock crystal]]. After digging in the northern part of the [[Island of Celebration]], Twinsen charged the pistol with rock crystal, making it workable. Without the pistol, Twinsen could not advance in his adventure, as the pistol was needed to access the [[Francos harbour|harbour of the Francos]].
