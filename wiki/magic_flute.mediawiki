'''The Magic Flute''' is a flute with magic powers. Its magic is expressed in two ways: melting frozen water, and growing flowers in the desert.

[[Twinsen]] finds the flute under the [[Eclipse Stone]] in [[Proxima Island]]. When reaching the [[Clear Water Lake]] in the [[Hamalayi Mountains]], Twinsen discovers that the lake is frozen. By playing the flute, Twinsen manages to melt the frozen lake, and thus fill a [[flask of clear water]].

Later on, Twinsen has to bring a [[space guitar]] to a band playing in the [[Twinsun Caf√©]]. Finding no further use for the flute, Twinsen trades it with an old [[rabbibunny]] in the [[White Leaf Desert]] for his guitar. With the flute, the rabbibunny is able to fulfill an old dream of his- grow flowers in the desert.
