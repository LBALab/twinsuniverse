==Description==
'''The Magic Flute''', as may be understood from its name, is a flute with magic powers. Its magic is expressed in two ways: melting frozen water, and growing flowers in the desert.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
[[Twinsen]] found the flute under one of the [[Runic Stones]] in [[Proxima Island]]. However, he did not find any use for it until later on in his quests, when reaching [[Clear Water Lake]] in the [[Himalayi Mountains]]. There, he had to melt the frozen water in order to obtain a [[flask of clear water]], one of the four elements of [[Legend of Sendell|prophecy]]. With the aid of the flute, Twinsen melted the frozen water.

Later on, Twinsen had to bring a [[space guitar]] to a band playing in the [[Twinsun Caf√©]]. Finding no further use for the flute, Twinsen traded it with the old [[rabbibunny]] in the [[White Leaf Desert|desert]] for his guitar. With the flute, the old rabbibunny was able to fulfill an old dream of his- grow flowers in the desert.
