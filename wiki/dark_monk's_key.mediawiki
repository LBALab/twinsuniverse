==Description==
'''Dark Monk's key''' is made of the union of the four fragments of the [[Esmer]] races. Once placing it upon the sacred alter of [[Dark Monk's temple]], [[Dark Monk's statue|the idol's statue]] will appear, accompanied by lightning and fancy lava ignitions, which will eventually complete the ceremony.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
After [[Twinsen]] retrieved all four key fragments, he reunited them to obtain Dark Monk's key. Upon completing this quest, he also received the last level of magic, giving him the ability to cast [[Magic ball|fire balls]]. Following [[Dark Monk's prophecy|the prophecy]] and other rumors that he heard of, Twinsen travelled to the [[Island of the Celebration]]. Once there, he entered the Temple of Dark Monk and placed the key on an alter that is surrounded by the four statues of the Esmer races. The giant statue of the worshipped god teared through the ground, bringing the idol of Dark Monk with him. Twinsen steped out of the temple, and was then forced to engage the god in a gruesome conflict.

Qutoe=Once, long ago, our god, Dark Monk, condemned us, the people of Zeelich, to live forever on our planet which he then turned into hell to make it seem more of a real condemnation. Each of the four races received a fragment of a key. These must be reunited during a great ceremony. And when our people have atoned for their sins, Dark Monk will rid us of the curse and give Zeelich back its original appearance. Today, he's returned and we all await the next and lat ceremony. Twinsen, do not dare interfere with the religious practice of our people.|
