==Description==
The Zeelich Gazette is a newspaper published on [[Zeelich]]. Unlike other newspapers like [[The Inquirer]], it is not a serious newspaper, but most likely a paper of the yellow press, as it was not focussing on [[Twinsen]] like all other newspapers did after Twinsen was recognized by a [[Franco guard]] on the [[Island of the Celebration]], but rather tells about the life of [[Johnny Rocket]].
