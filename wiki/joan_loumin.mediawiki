'''Joan Loumin''' is a [[mosquibee]] acting as part of the [[dissidents]] group on [[Zeelich]].

His name is not mentioned in the actual game, and is only written in the official [[Little Big Adventure 2]] website [http://www.littlebigadventure2.com/lba2/FAMILLE/MOSQUIEN.HTM]. [[Twinsen]] meets him in several different places during the game.

Twinsen first meets Joan during his first trip to [[Zeelich]], while escaping from the [[Otringal]] [[Otringal prison|prison]]. Joan is held as a prisoner in another cell, and Twinsen can release him by hitting the switch on the top floor. While this is not a neccessarry part of the game, a player who does release Joan gets an advice from him about leaving through the back door, as the front entrance is heavily guarded. Understanding Joan at this point requires owning a [[translator]], and a player who did not pick one earlier in the game hears Zeelichian from him instead.

Twinsen later meets Joan and his dissident fellows at the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]] in Otringal. They help him prepare for his trip to [[Island CX]], and hand him a [[Laser Pistol]].

When arriving to the [[Island of the Mosquibees]], Twinsen sees Joan standing next to the queen [[Astrid]]. When Astrid asks Twinsen for a proof of his good intentions, Joan hints him that it is the [[dissidents ring]] she's looking for.

Joan later witnesses Twinsen undergoing the Test of Truth at the [[Challenge room]]. Just after Twinsen completes the challenge, the emperor's soldiers attack the village, and Joan, together with the queen and another mosquibee, is captured. They are being held prisoners at the [[Building Company]] in [[Wannies Island]].

Twinsen goes to their cell in the Building Company, in order to get the [[key to Island CX]] from the queen. Joan advices him to get there as soon as possible.

Joan is lastly seen at the end of the game, in the party on [[Citadel Island]].

==Character origins==
The model for Joan Loumin is the active member of French Resistance during the World War II [[Wikipedia:Jean Moulin|Jean Moulin]], who was one of the most active French Resistance members during the World War II, close to the commanders and captured by the enemy more than once. To add to the similarity, Jean Moulin's image is associated with a scarf he often wore to hide scarring and the typical for the time period fedora hat.
