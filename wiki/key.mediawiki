'''Keys''' are used for opening doors and gates. [[Twinsen]] usually obtains them by either searching in plants or garbage bins, or by killing a guard keeping the key. He can take a key by either walking over it, or by throwing his [[magic ball]] at it, as it is attracted to keys.

If Twinsen goes out of a room, he loses all the keys in his possesion, regardless of whether the door he passes requires a key or not. The number of keys Twinsen has is indicated in the [[control panel]].
