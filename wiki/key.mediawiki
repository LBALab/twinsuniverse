==Description==
Found more or less everywhere around [[Twinsun]] and [[Zeelich]], these '''keys''' act just like any normal keys; they open most of the doors and gates around the planets. If requiring a key, a person cannot pass through the door without one. The keys common on the two planets are rather small, and are coloured gold.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
During his two adventures, in quite a lot of places, Twinsen was required to use a key in order to open a specific door. He got these keys in various ways, either from the person owning them, from the enemy guiding them, or just by searching through plants or rubbish cans. Either way, once owning the key, he was able to open any of the locked doors on the screen.

==Trivia==
Once leaving the room at which he retrieved the key, Twinsen was unable to use the key any more. Apparently, the [[quetch]] was not wise enough, and used his keys even on open doors.

==Unconfirmed theories==
For unknown reasons, all keys seem to open any type of a door. Apparently, all keys are identical on Twinsun and Zeelich. Either this, or simply each key fits the doors at the room where the key was found.
