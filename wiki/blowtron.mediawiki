The '''blowtron''' is a weapon firing projectiles. It is quite similar to the [[blowgun]], butis faster and causes more damage. Its widest aperture, as well as it's thicker size, enable it to be loaded with larger berries.

Searching for a way of reaching [[Island CX]], [[Twinsen]] reaches the [[Mosquibees Village]], where he meets [[Queen Astrid]]. To prove to the suspicious queen that his intentions are good, he has to pass the [[Test of Truth]]. Upon passing the challenge, Twinsen receives the blowtron, a symbol for him being an equal of the mosquibees.
