==Description==
The '''Duams''' are a dog-like race found in some places around [[Zeelich]]. They are being used as pets and they've got all differents kinds of colours.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In the [[Casino Gloum]] at the [[Middle City]] of [[Otringal]], there are three different games. One of them is a dog race done by Duams. [[Twinsen]] could place a bet of 1 [[zlito]] on any of the Duams. If the Duam he bet on won the race, Twinsen was awarded 10 zlitos.

==Trivia==
After a few trials at the race, Twinsen found a way of cheating; by using the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]], he was able to place a [[life candy]] on the race. Then, by betting on the appropriate course, he was most likely to win the desired zlitos, as the Duams used these candies to go faster.
