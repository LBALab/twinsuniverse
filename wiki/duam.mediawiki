'''Duam''' are a dog-like race used for gambling races in the [[casino]] on [[Otringal]].

The Duams race is one of the games available at the casino. [[Twinsen]] can place a bet of 1 [[Zlito]] on any of the Duams, and if the Duam he bets on wins the race, Twinsen is awarded 10 Zlitos.

It's possible to cheat in this race, by dispensing a [[life candy]] from the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]] on any of the courses. The duam who touches this heart becomes faster, and is more likely to win this race.
