**The Magic Flute** is a flute with magic powers. Its magic is expressed
in two ways: melting frozen water, and growing flowers in the desert.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") finds the flute under the [Eclipse
Stone](Eclipse_Stone "wikilink") in [Proxima
Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink"). When reaching the [Clear Water
Lake](Clear_Water_Lake "wikilink") in the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink"), Twinsen discovers that the
lake is frozen. By playing the flute, Twinsen manages to melt the frozen
lake, and thus fill a [flask of clear
water](flask_of_clear_water "wikilink").

Later on, Twinsen has to bring a [space guitar](space_guitar "wikilink")
to a band playing in the [Twinsun Café](Twinsun_Café "wikilink").
Finding no further use for the flute, Twinsen trades it with an old
[rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink") in the [White Leaf
Desert](White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink") for his guitar. With the flute,
the rabbibunny is able to fulfill an old dream of his- grow flowers in
the desert.
