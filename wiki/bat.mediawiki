'''Bats''' live in dark caves and abandoned buildings. They fly around alone or sometimes with one or two more bats. Bats are hard to kill by slow ranged attacks, but easier by melee or fast ranged attacks.

On their own bats won't attack, but will hit Twinsen once when he walks in their path. He can be hit by 1 or 2 lifepoints.
