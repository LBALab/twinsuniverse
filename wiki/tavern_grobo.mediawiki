==Description==
The '''tavern grobo''' is a [[grobo]] who often visited [[Chez Luc]] in [[Lupin-Burg]] during [[FunFrock's Reign]]. He could usually be found on the first floor.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
After [[Zoé]] had been captured by [[Clone|grobo clones]], [[Twinsen]] was looking for clues about what happened to her. When asking around in Chez Luc, he eventually encountered the grobo, who was willing to give Twinsen a hint when he ordered a drink for him. After Twinsen did so, he was told that Zoé has been to the [[Citadel Island harbour|harbour]] in order to get taken to another island. So Twinsen got up to get to the harbour himself.

 |quote=I saw them at the port a little while ago. They were leaving for another island. It's strange, because prisoners usually stay at the Citadel.
