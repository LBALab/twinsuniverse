The **Book of Bù** is one of the four magic items that were needed to be
collected by [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") to fullfill the [prophecy of
Sendell](prophecy_of_Sendell "wikilink").

After reading a rare book at The [library](library "wikilink")'s
censored publications area, Twinsen goes [Island of the White Leaf
Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"), where he meets an
old [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink"). The rabbibunny tells him that
he knows about the so-called legend that [FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink")
fears, and promises to tell him about it if he brings him the Book of Bù
from the [Temple of Bù](Temple_of_Bù "wikilink").

After getting through all the obstacles of the Temple, Twinsen finally
makes it to the last room. There, surrounded by old dead-yet-alive
rabbibunnies skeletons, he finds the book spinning in air. Instead of
trying to fight the skeletons, Twinsen can run straight to the book,
which causes the skeletons to stop fighting him, and bow to him instead.

The book tells the exact [prophecy of
Sendell](prophecy_of_Sendell "wikilink"), and describes clearly the
events that post factum did happen at Twinsen's adventure:

From this book, Twinsen learned his actual destiny: to overthrow the
tyrant - Dr. FunFrock.

Once owning the book, Twinsen can speak with the animals of
[Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"), as well as read the ancient language of
the planet, Runic. The book also promoted his [magic
level](magic_ball "wikilink") from yellow to green.

After getting out of the temple, Twinsen gives the book to the old
rabbibunny, who thus figures Twinsen must be the heir the prophecy
speaks of. The rabbibunny then tells Twinsen about the Legend, and sends
him to [his house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink") to continue his quest.

During Little Big Adventure 2, the book is held at [Miss Bloop's Private
Museum](Miss_Bloop's_Private_Museum "wikilink"). However, Twinsen is
still able to speak with the animals of Twinsen, despite not owning the
book any more.
