'''Roger de la Fontaine's Brother''' is [[Franco]] whose name is unknown. He was the brother of [[Roger de la Fontaine]], the late Burgermaster of the [[Island of the Francos]].

Even though the rest of the island is caught up in the treasure hunt for the lost [[Francos Fragment]], Roger's brother doesn't seem too interested in finding the fragment. He does nothing to help try and find it, and is sceptical that anyone will.

[[Twinsen]] learns from Roger's brother about Roger and what happened to him. He reveals that there are [[Burgermaster's Notes|notes]] in the house with clues about finding the lost fragment, but that he lost the [[Burgermaster's Key|key]] to the closet holding them.

Even after Twinsen finds the francos fragment and shows it to Roger's brother, he does not believe that it is the true fragment.
