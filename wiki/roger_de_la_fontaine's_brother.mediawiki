'''Roger de la Fontaine's brother''' is [[Franco]] whose name is unknown. He was the brother of [[Roger de la Fontaine]], the late Burgermaster of the [[Island of the Francos]].

Even though the rest of the island is caught up in the treasure hunt for the lost [[Francos fragment]], Roger's brother does nothing to help try and find it.

[[Twinsen]] learns from Roger's brother about Roger and what happened to him. He revelas that there are [[burgermaster's notes|notes]] in the house with clues about finding the lost fragment, but that he lost the [[burgermaster's key|key]] to the closet holding them.

Even after Twinsen finds the francos fragment and shows it to Roger's brother, he does not believe that it is the true fragment.
