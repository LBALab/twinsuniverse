==Description==
Roger de la Fontaine's brother is a nameless Franco, the brother of [[Roger de la Fontaine]], the late Burgermaster of the [[Island of the Francos]]. He is often quick to dismiss others, and skeptical about most things people tell him. He isn't easily fooled.

Even though the rest of the island is caught up in the treasure hunt for the lost [[Francos fragment]], he does nothing to help try and find it.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Roger de la Fontaine's brother told [[Twinsen]] about his brother, and how the fragment got lost.
