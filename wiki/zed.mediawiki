==Description==
Zed is a grobo living on [[Citadel Island]]. His only hobby seems to be collecting mushrooms, something he likes doing while it rains. He also likes to lay at the beach during sunnier weather.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Zed had no real role in [[Twinsen]]'s adventures. He only gave Twinsen some hints, like most characters. In his case: Twinsen can drown, where to seek [[Raph]] and that mushrooms could come in handy.

==Additional quotes==

{{Quote
 |quote=The Esmers should come here. It feels so good to look for mushrooms. By the way, I wouldn't try to go swimming, it gets deep very rapidly.
