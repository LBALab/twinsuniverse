**Tanks** are heavy battle tanks in the army of
[FunFrock](FunFrock "wikilink").

The tanks are used mainly for defending actions and attacking actions as
well. There can be found one in the middle of
[Lupin-Burg](Lupin-Burg "wikilink"), enforcing surveillance. It was also
used to destroy [Twinsen's house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink"). There are
also tanks guarding FunFrock's fortresses, or the [Okojo
Pass](Okojo_Pass "wikilink") in the [Hamalayi
Mountains](Hamalayi_Mountains "wikilink"). They could also be seen on
[Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink").

During the rebel assault on the [Okojo Pass](Okojo_Pass "wikilink"),
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") and a rebel rabbibunny steal a tank in
order to get access to the small fort guarding the pass. However, the
tank is not controlled by Twinsen, but by the rebel rabbibunny instead.

Twinsen also has to destroy a tank guarding [FunFrock's secret
fortress](FunFrock's_secret_fortress "wikilink"), in order to get access
to it.
