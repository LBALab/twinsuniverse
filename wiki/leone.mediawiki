'''Leone''' is a sphero working for the healing wizard [[Ker'aooc]] as his [[housemaid]]. During most of the time in [[Little Big Adventure 2]] she is seen cleaning [[Ker'aooc's house|his house]] in [[Port-Ludo]].

[[Twinsen]] first meets Leone in the [[pharmacy]] on [[Citadel Island]], when she tells him she has an idea how to help [[Dino-Fly]]. Just then, her [[umbrella]] is stolen by a [[Umbrella thief|thief]] [[rabbibunny]]. Giving her back the umbrella, Twinsen learns from Leone that he can go visit the healing wizard for assistance.

When Twinsen goes to [[Desert Island]] to look for the wizard, he finds Leone in the wizard's house, where she tells him that Ker'aooc would be gone for a while. She suggests Twinsen to search for the [[School of Magic]] in case it's an emergency.

Twinsen can also take the [[Flask of gallic acid]] from Ker'aooc's house. Leone says that he can take, as Ker'aooc doesn't use it.
