The '''keypad controlling a digital locking system''' is a special object that acts as a key to a secret room in the [[Teleportation Center]]. [[Twinsen]] gets it from [[Lanktir]], a [[grobo]] living in [[Proxim-City]], in [[Little Big Adventure 1]]. Lanktir had recieved the keypad by accident.

The keypard is not an integral part of the game, but Twinsen can use it to open the secret room in the Teleportation Center. This room is full of [[Meca-Penguin]]s, but it is only possible to have one penguin at a time in LBA 1.
