==Description==
The '''keypad controlling a digital locking system''' is a special object that acted as a key to a secret room in the [[Teleportation Center]]. [[Twinsen]] got it from [[Lanktir]], a [[grobo]] living in [[Proxim-City]], during his first adventure. Lanktir had recieved the keypad by accident.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

The keypad did not actually help Twinsen on his quest, but he could use it to steal a [[Meca-Penguin]] from the secret room.
