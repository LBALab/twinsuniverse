## Description

With the aid of this small, silver, dome-shaped **translator**,
[Twinsunians](Twinsun "wikilink") are able to understand and speak the
[Esmers](Esmer "wikilink")' language.

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

Not being able to undertand the Esmers' language,
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") needed at a translator to be able to
understand the [Zeelichians](Zeelich "wikilink"). Possible locations
where he got the translator from are a space shuttle, the
[prison](Otringal_prison "wikilink") on [Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"),
or from [Jerome Baldino](Jerome_Baldino "wikilink") himself.

If he did not have one before boarding the [Esmer
shuttle](Esmer_shuttle "wikilink") to the [Emerald
Moon](Emerald_Moon "wikilink"), Twinsen was unable to understand what
the Moon Base question, and therefore, did not answer. The guards
outside, understanding Twinsen did not know the right password tried to
kill him then.

## Unconfirmed theories

The translator obviously translates the Esmers' language to the
Twinsunian one. However, it is unknown whether inhabitants of other
planets may also use this device to understand the Zeelichian language,
or even any other language.
