**Moya** is a giant Sea Turtle residing inside the sea surrounding the
[Island of the White Leaf
Desert](Island_of_the_White_Leaf_Desert "wikilink"). She is mostly seen
around the southern beach of the island, either near the
[oasis](oasis "wikilink") or near the west side of
[Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink"). Moya is willing to take people on her
back for sea trips. To use her services, one should ring the bells
located near either of those two places.

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") rings these bells, Moya comes and
invites him to jump on her back to go somewhere. At the oasis, she
brings Twinsen to a rock in the water where he can find a [clover
box](clover_box "wikilink"). Near the harbour, she brings him to the
[Cave of the Pearl of
Incandescence](Cave_of_the_Pearl_of_Incandescence "wikilink").
