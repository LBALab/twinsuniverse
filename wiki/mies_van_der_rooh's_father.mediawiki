==Description==

Mies Van Der Rooh's father is seen In LBA2. He is Twinsen's neighbour, also living in Bug Street on Citidel Island.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==

In Lba2, he has the map of the sewers which for him to properly unveil, he needs a vial of Gallac Acid, which Twinsem retrieves on Desert Island from Kara'ooc's house. He also gives you a pyramid key which is a vital point in the game, so you can open the secret room in the sewers where Twinsen gets the Sendell's Ball.

==Additional Quotes==

Here we have a very instructive map of the sewers. Before you can consult it, you must wait until I restore it. For that, I need a vial of gallic acid. Unfortunately, there's none left on the island.

The gallic acid has revealed a text previously invisible. It mentions a small pyramid that was in my possession. Here! It's yours!
