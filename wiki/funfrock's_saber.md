**FunFrock's Saber** is a saber (often also known as the **Magic
Saber**) that once belonged to [Dr. FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink"),
although he does not actually use it in the game. This saber is
considered the most powerful weapon on [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink"),
and is capable of killing most creatures.

In [Little Big Adventure 1](Little_Big_Adventure_1 "wikilink"), the
saber is locked in a safe in [FunFrock's
headquarters](FunFrock's_headquarters "wikilink") at [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink"). This safe is guarded by a few
[clones](clones "wikilink"), including a clone of FunFrock himself.

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") finds the sword in the safe when he comes
to the hadquarters to search for the plans of the [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink").

The way Twinsen uses the saber may varies, depending on his behaviour:

- **Normal**: Twinsen hits the enemy by walking forward and cutting.
- **Sporty**: Twinsen jumps back once and then forward to hit the enemy.
- **Agressive**: Twinsen acts extremer than in Normal mode, and also
  jumps and turns a couple of times at the enemy.
- **Discreet**: Twinsen uses the sword as silent as possible. He also
  acts the least aggresive.

Using the sword, Twinsen is able to defeat some enemies he couldn't
beforehand, such as [red clones](red_clones "wikilink"). In the final
battle against FunFrock in the [Well of
Sendell](Well_of_Sendell "wikilink"), it's possible to kill him only
with the sword.
