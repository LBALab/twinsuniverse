==Description==
The '''Garden Balsam Flower''' is a rare flower which grows in the desert, especially in rocky areas. It is used mainly for a [[School of Magic]]'s test, for which pupils have to fetch the [[Mentor of the School of Magic|mentor]] this rare flower.

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
The very first thing [[Twinsen]] had to do at the beginning of his second adventure, was to heal his [[Dino-Fly]]. For that, he joined the School of Magic, where he was promised to obtain the power to treat Dino-Fly by passing one of the tests of wizardry. This test was the Garden Balsam Flower test. In this test, Twinsen had find a Garden Balsam flower, and bring it to the Mentor of the school.

Since this flower only grows on rocky areas, Twinsen needed a car to complete this test. After [[Zoé]] fixed their car, Twinsen was able complete this test, by climbing with the car on a nearby mountain, and then jumping to the mountain across, at which he found the flower.

In return for the garden balsam, the Mentor gave Twinsen the [[Horn of the Blue Triton]], a horn which enables one to heal others, or even themselves. With this horn, Twinsen could finally heal Dino-Fly, and then complete the third and last test for the School of Magic- the [[Dome of the Slate]] test.

==Trivia==
After Twinsen received the horn, he came back to the place where he found the flower. By dispensing a [[heart]] there, he enabled the flower to re-grow. The mentor of the school then popped up, and, congratulating Twinsen for the idea, awarded him with a couple of [[clovers]].
