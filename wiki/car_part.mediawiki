==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In order to complete the [[School of Magic]]'s [[Garden Balsam]] test, Twinsen needed the aid of a car. However, his current automobile was broken. The [[quetch]] asked [[Baldino]] for the proper tool needed in order to fix the car. Baldino gave it to Twinsen who in return ended up giving it away to his girlfriend.
