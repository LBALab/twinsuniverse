## Description

A rabbibunny who taxi's citizens around [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink") for a small fare.

He is found in a garage during the rain complaining about the storm.
After the rain stops, he drives around the town square. If
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") stops him, he will offer to give him a
ride up to the [Flower Circle](Ridge_of_the_Flowers_Circle‏‎ "wikilink").

## Role in Twinsen's adventure

In LBA2 the scooterbunny can take you for a ride to the furthest points
of Citidel Island ([Weather Wizard tent](Weather_Wizard_tent "wikilink")
and [Lighthouse](Lighthouse "wikilink")) aswell as
[Lupin-Burg](Lupin-Burg "wikilink") City for only 8 kashes. He only
drives his scooter when it is sunny. When it is raining on Citidel
Island he provides you with a hint that you can jump while you're
running to go further.
