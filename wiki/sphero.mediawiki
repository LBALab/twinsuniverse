'''Sphero''' is one of the four main species of Twinsun. This race of small bio-androids has been living for years on [[Twinsun]] as an endangered species. Unfortunately, they have been unable to breed for a very long time and have only a dim hope of seeing tiny spheros cavorting around their gardens.
