==Description==
The '''Wizard's Diploma''' is the official proof that the owner is a fully licensed wizard. This diplioma is given to anyone who graduates from the [[School of Magic]] by the [[Rector of the School of Magic|rector]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
In order to heal his [[Dino-Fly]], [[Twinsen]] had to become a fully licensed wizard. For this, he had to pass three tests: the [[Magic Ball]] test, the [[Garden Balsam]] test, and the [[Dome of the Slate]] test.

Upon completion of all three tests, Twinsen became a wizard, and received the desired diploma, making his magic level rise to Green Ball. He was then able to buy a [[wizard's parade tunic]] from the wizard [[Chedil Amiradoo]], which made him look like a wizard. He was then able to go to [[Zeelich]], and find out more details about the disappearance of the wizards.

When arriving on Zeelich for the second time, Twinsen found no more use for the diploma, and, needing the money, sold it to the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]].
