'''Franco''' is one of the four main species of the planet [[Zeelich]]. Their shape resembles a sausage, and most of them live in the [[Island of the Francos]], on [[Zeelich's surface]].

A plaque in [[Dark Monk's temple]] describes the Francos as so:
{{Quote
 |Franco representative. The Francos live on the island of the Francos, (what a surprise!), which is enshrouded by the gas swarming with monsters. The Francos refine the gems extracted in the under-gas, and turn them into gazogem, usable by all the vehicles of Zeelich.

As can be seen, the refining of [[gazogem]] from [[gem]]s in the [[gazogem refinery]] provides a main income source for the Francos. This is also mentioned in their description in the official [[Little Big Adventure 2]] website:

{{Quote
 |A sausage-like race (with all due respects) living on an island which is particularly vulnerable to gas monsters. They control GazoGem production in their refinery, a fuel extracted from the gems mined in the sub-gas. They are also used as soldiers, policemen, guards, and paratroopers in the Emperor's army. They are first-rankers in all battles, raids and all other forms of butchery!
 |From the [//www.magicball.net/mirrors/official-lba2/FAMILLE/FRANCOS.HTM Official LBA 2 site]}}

During his adventures in Zeelich, Twinsen mainly finds Francos in Francos Island. At that time, most of them are searching for the lost [[Francos Fragment]]. There are also quite a lot of Francos in [[Otringal]] and the [[Island of the Wannies]], mainly serving as [[franco guard|guards]] and policemen. During the [[Emperor]]'s invasion of the [[Island of the Mosquibees]], the Francos are serving as parachuters. A few Franco guards also come to [[Twinsun]] with the [[Esmer]]s.

"Franco" is perhaps a pun on "Frankfurt", the city famous for its sausage industry.
