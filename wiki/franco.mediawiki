Quote=Franco representative. The Francos live on the island of the Francos, (what a surprise!), which is enshrouded by the gas swarming with monsters. The Francos refine the gems extracted in the under-gas, and turn them into gazogem, usable by all the vehicles of Zeelich.|

A sausage-like race (with all due respects) living on an island which is particularly vulnerable to gas monsters. They control GazoGem production in their refinery, a fuel extracted from the gems mined in the sub-gas. They are also used as soldiers, policemen, guards, and paratroopers in the Emperor's army. They are first-rankers in all battles, raids and all other forms of butchery!
