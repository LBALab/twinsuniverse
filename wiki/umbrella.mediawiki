 |This umbrella belongs to a pharmacy customer.
 |Inventory, [[Umbrella]]
 |quoteid=1870}}

==Description==
This is just a common '''umbrella''', coloured beige. It belongs to [[Leone]], the cleaner of the Healing Wizard, [[Ker'aooc]].

==Role in Twinsen's adventure==
Looking for a way to treat his [[Dino-Fly]], [[Twinsen]] went to the [[pharmacy]], where he witnessed the stealing of this umbrella. Leone, the rightful owner of the umbrella, was willing to help Twinsen find a cure for Dino-Fly, if the [[quetch]] would bring her the umbrella back. To retrieve the umbrella, Twinsen had to sneak to the rabbibunny thief, thus being able to scare him and get the umbrella from him. Once returning the umbrella to Leone, the sphero advised Twinsen to go meet the [[Ker'aooc|healing wizard]] at [[Desert Island]].

==Trivia==
Twinsen was able to sell the umbrella at the [[Twinsunian Souvenir Shop]], for the decent price of 20 [[zlito]]s.
