**Patrick** is a [Gloum](Gloum "wikilink") (an Alligator-like creature)
who works at [Casino Gloum](Casino_Gloum "wikilink") on
[Otringal](Otringal "wikilink"), who welcomes the winners of the key to
the [Super Jackpot chamber](Super_Jackpot_chamber "wikilink") next to
the Wheel of Fortune. He acts nice, but is actually the same as all
other Gloums; an agressive fraud.

When [Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") enters the Super Jackpot chamber at
the casino, Patrick instructs him about spinning the wheel. Once Twinsen
gives the wheel a spin, another Gloum comes down from above, and with
Patrick, they start hitting Twinsen and rob him of all his money.
Killing Patrick and the other Gloum pays well- 50
[Zlitos](Zlito "wikilink") from each of them, plus the
[key](key "wikilink") to the door to the outside.
