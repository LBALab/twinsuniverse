==Description==
'''The Protection Spell''' gives its owner the ability to become completely immune towards virtually any attack. The spell consumes plenty of [[magic points]], while it's being used and won't work anymore as soon as the person runs out of magic points. The only harm this spell doesn't protect against is falling into water, lava or gas.

==Role in Twinsen's adventures==
The Protection Spell was one of two spells that [[Twinsen]] obtained during his second adventure. Twinsen received the Protection Spell from the [[Island across the Hacienda]]. Even though the Protection Spell was not necessary for completing his quest, it could still be quite handy during various points and obstacles within the two planets.
