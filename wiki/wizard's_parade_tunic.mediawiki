== Description ==
This '''parade tunic''' is worn by the wizards from [[Twinsun]]. It makes the owner recognizable as a wizard. These tunics are given to anyone who graduates from the [[School of Magic]]. In case the school has none left in stock, they will be supplied by the local wizard's accessories seller, [[Chedil Amiradoo]].

== Role in Twinsen's adventure ==
Upon graduating from the School of Magic, [[Twinsen]] was told about the myserious disappearance of all wizards of the planet. Following the request of the [[Mentor of the School of Magic|mentor of the school]], Twinsen went out to search for them. Once graduating from the school Twinsen was able buy a wizard's parade tunic from Chedil Amiradoo.

The [[Esmers]], not recognizing Twinsen, thought he was just a harmless wizard they can kidnap. Twinsen was invited to a tour around [[Zeelich]], which was a cover for the Esmers' plans of kidnapping all the wizards. None of the Esmers recognized Twinsen, until [[Joe]] accidently betrayed him by revealing his true identity. Twinsen was then captured, and lost his wizard's costume.

If it wasn't for the costume, Twinsen would not have been able to go to Zeelich with the Esmers.
