'''Mrs. Brune''' is a [[rabbibunny]] working at the [[Ticket office (Citadel Island)|ticket office]] in the [[Citadel Island harbour]]. She has two kids: a child rabbibunny studying in the school, and an older son known as the [[Umbrella Thief]].

She is upset that it is raining and the kids at the school cannot go out to the [[Ridge of the Flowers Circle|flower circle]].

Mrs. Brune only gives [[Twinsen]] a small hint, regarding [[Raph]] the [[lighthouse]] keeper.
