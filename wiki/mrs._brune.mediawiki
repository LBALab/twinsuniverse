'''Mrs. Brune''' is a [[rabbibunny]] working at the [[Ticket office (Citadel Island)|ticket office]] in the [[Citadel Island harbour]]. She has two kids: a child rabbibunny studying in the school, and an older son known in the game as the [[umbrella thief]].

Mrs. Brune has no vital role in the game, and she only gives [[Twinsen]] a small hint, regarding [[Raph]] the [[lighthouse]] keeper.
