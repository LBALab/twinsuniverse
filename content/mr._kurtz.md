**Kurtz** is a [franco](franco "wikilink") living in [Franco
Village](Franco_Village "wikilink") on the [Island of the
Francos](Island_of_the_Francos "wikilink"), in [a
house](Mr._Kurtz's_house "wikilink") where he made sure no sunlight can
come in. His flowers are the proof of that. According to the sign
outside his house, Mr. Kurtz is a retired colonel. He currently works as
a scientist.

Kurtz is one of the many Francos searching for their
[fragment](Francos_Fragment "wikilink") which is lost on the island. He
spends his time in his house concocting a potion which he believes will
lead him directly to the fragments location. Unfortunately, he lost the
vial which contained the potion.
