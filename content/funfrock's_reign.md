## Background

(the story up to Twinsen getting arrested)

## The Southern Hemisphere

### Escape from the Citadel

Twinsen woke up in a small prison cell inside the
[Citadel](Citadel "wikilink"). By drawing the attention of the
[quetch](quetch "wikilink") [nurse](nurse "wikilink") who guards the
jail cells, he managed to get close enough to the nurse to beat him up,
and escape from the cell using the his elevator. Twinsen then managed to
kill a [doctor](doctor "wikilink"), just before he could reach the alarm
button, which would summon a [Super-Grobo clone](Supergro "wikilink")
who would capture Twinsen and put him back in his cell.

Exploring the facility for a bit (and killing a few other doctors who
got in his), Twinsen was able to find a [nurse's
uniform](nurse's_uniform "wikilink"). This disguise helped him get close
enough to one of the doctors, so he could kill him before the doctor
sounded the alarm.

After escaping from the Citadel, Twinsen faced another obstacle - the
exit was guarded by a [terrain soldier](terrain_soldier "wikilink").
Silently and carefully, Twinsen was able to sneak behind the soldier,
and hid in a pile of garbage. When a [garbage
truck](garbage_truck "wikilink") finally came by, Twinsen seized the
opportunity to hop on the truck, thus escaping the eyes of the guard,
and the Citadel.

### Searching for Zoé

Quickly, Twinsen ran across [Citadel Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"),
carefully avoiding several [clones](clone "wikilink") who were guarding
the path, and looking after him. Finally, he reached [his
house](Twinsen's_house "wikilink"), where he was reunited with his
girlfriend, [Zoé](Zoé "wikilink"), but not for long... While Twinsen was
hiding from the clones inside his home, a pair of [Grobo
clones](Grobo_clone "wikilink") came to search for him. When they
couldn't find him, they arrested Zoé, possibly so that Twinsen would
come looking for her.

Twinsen left his house to search for Zoé, but remembered to take the
[Magic Ball](Magic_Ball "wikilink") and the [Ancestral
Tunic](Ancestral_Tunic "wikilink") left by his ancestors, as they would
undoubtedly help him fight the clones. While exploring Citadel Island,
and asking people about Zoé, Twinsen ran into an old "friend" of his -
the local [pharmacist](Pharmacist_(Quetch) "wikilink"). The pharmacist
was quite scared when he saw Twinsen out of prison, as he was possibly
the one to inform the authorities about Twinsen's dreams. In response to
seeing Twinsen, he tried to raise the alarm, which forced Twinsen to
kill him and the clone who came to arrest him. Seizing the opportunity,
Twinsen also searched the [pharmacy](pharmacy "wikilink") for any useful
items, only to find a [Bottle of Syrup](Bottle_of_Syrup "wikilink"), and
some [kashes](kashes "wikilink").

Eventually, Twinsen found a [grobo](grobo "wikilink") in [Chez
Luc](Chez_Luc "wikilink"), who told him (in exchange for a drink) that
he had seen Zoé and the grobos heading to [the
port](Citadel_Island_Harbour "wikilink"). Twinsen went to the port, and
requested a [ferry ticket](ferry_ticket "wikilink") - only to be
recognized as an escapee, causing the ticket seller to sound the alarm.
He quickly ran out, and found a rather disgruntled grobo sailor. The
sailor was upset with his job, and offered Twinsen a ticket, if Twinsen
could help him arrange the boxes in the
[warehouse](warehouse "wikilink"),
[Sokoban](wikipedia:Sokoban "wikilink") style. Of course, Twinsen
agreed, and performed the job perfectly.

### Exploring Principal Island

(doing everything there is to do on Principal Island - the library, the
astronomer, etc. This might need to be parted into two sections)

### Desert Island and The Temple of Bù

When he reached [Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink"), Twinsen had
to face many dangers. The only access to the island was through a beach,
surrounded by a set of islets, which Twinsen had to carefully jump
between (as Twinsen doesn't know how to swim). After avoiding several
[mines](mines "wikilink") and [machine guns](machine_gun "wikilink"),
Twinsen managed to grab a [key](key "wikilink") from one of the
[soldiers](Terrain_soldier "wikilink"), and access the restricted
inner-area of Desert Island.

There, Twinsen found an [old rabbibunny](Old_Wiseman "wikilink"),
sitting by a small well. The rabbibunny told him about the [Temple of
Bù](Temple_of_Bù "wikilink"), an ancient temple buried under the sand.
He informed Twinsen that the small well is in fact a ventilation shaft
which leads inside the temple, which contained a [sacred
book](Book_of_Bù "wikilink"). The rabbibunny promised Twinsen that if he
got him the book, he would tell him all he knows about The Legend.

The Temple of Bù was possibly the hardest part of Twinsen's adventure.
Twinsen had to solve several difficult puzzles (such as pushing a statue
from one end of the room to another, assisted by a series of elevators),
all while avoiding numerous traps and enemies, such as spikes,
fireball-shooting statues, [skeletons](skeleton "wikilink") and strange
[bouncing rocks](bouncing_rock "wikilink").

When he finally reached the [Book of Bù](Book_of_Bù "wikilink"), Twinsen
realized that the skeletons are no longer attacking him - instead, they
started bowing in respect. An inscription on a nearby wall informed
Twinsen that the book enabled him to speak to
[animals](animals "wikilink"), and read ancient
[runes](runes "wikilink"), such as the one in the inscription. The book
had also strengthened Twinsen magic, promoting his magic level from
yellow to green.

When exiting the temple, Twinsen found himself on a bizarre, floating
piece of land, and was mysteriously transported back to the desert,
where he met with the old hermit once again. The hermit informed Twinsen
that only the [Heir](Heir "wikilink") could have survived the Temple of
Bù, which must mean Twinsen is in fact the Heir, and that he is the one
who must save [Twinsun](Twinsun "wikilink") from [Dr.
FunFrock](Dr._FunFrock "wikilink"). He also told that Twinsen may find
more information inside his own [home](Twinsen's_house "wikilink").

Strangely enough, the [fisherman](fisherman "wikilink") who transported
Twinsen to [Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink") was still at the
beach, waiting to take Twinsen back to [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink").

### The Museum break-in

After returning to [Port-Belooga](Port-Belooga "wikilink"), Twinsen met
a [sphero](sphero "wikilink") decided to sell his
[boat](Catamaran "wikilink"). Even though it was a bit pricey (at 200
[kashes](kashes "wikilink")), Twinsen decided to buy the boat, thinking
he is probably be better off traveling independently, knowing that a
wanted poster with his picture is hung all around the main islands.
Also, because of the numerous treasures he found in the [Temple of
Bù](Temple_of_Bù "wikilink"), he could easily afford it.

With his brand new sail-boat, Twinsen traveled back to [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), to find more information regarding
[the Legend](Legend_of_Sendell "wikilink") in [his
home](Twinsen's_house "wikilink"). Twinsen remembered there was a cave
underneath his home, with a [locked room](the_Heir's_room "wikilink")
and some strange runes he could not read. Now that he had the [Book of
Bù](Book_of_Bù "wikilink") he was able to read them. According to the
runes, the [key to the room](Ancestral_Key "wikilink") was taken a long
time ago by a pirate named [LeBorgne](LeBorgne "wikilink"), whose
treasure's location is unknown. Twinsen soon went to seek information
regarding LeBorgne and his treasure.

After questioning several people around [Principal
Island](Principal_Island "wikilink") and [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), Twinsen found information regarding
LeBorgne in the Principal Island [library](library "wikilink").
According to a [secret
map](secret_map_of_LeBorgne's_treasure "wikilink"), the treasure could
be found somewhere on [Proxima Island](Proxima_Island "wikilink").
Following the (very specific) instructions on the map, Twinsen found
himself at the doorstep of the [Maritime
Museum](Maritime_Museum "wikilink").
