## Description

The entrance of the well protected [Teleportation
Center](Teleportation_Center "wikilink") was guarded by a nameless,
simple [Quetch](Quetch "wikilink"). His task was to ask visitors for
identification and open the Center's gates for them. He was armed with a
simple pistol, but when necessary he was helped by the two shooting
robots behind the gates.

## Role in Twinsen's Adventure

The Teleportation Center guard needed to give
[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") access to the Teleportation Center.
Twinsen needed to show [Mies van der Rooh's ID
card](Mies_van_der_Rooh's_ID_card "wikilink") in order to get entrance
to the building. Though the guard did not recognize Twinsen, he would
have attacked him in case Twinsen had used [his own ID
card](Twinsen's_ID_Card "wikilink").
