**Annie** is a [wannie](wannie "wikilink") working as [Mr.
Lemoine](Mr._Lemoine "wikilink")'s housemaid. She lives with her only
son in a small house in the [Village of the
Wannies](Village_of_the_Wannies "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") has to go to other islands in the
[under-gas](under-gas "wikilink"). Not knowing how to contact the
[ferryman](ferryman "wikilink"), he goes to the village of the wannies,
where the Priest tells him to ask his housemaid about it. Twinsen then
goes to Annie, who teaches him the [Ferryman's
Song](Ferryman's_Song "wikilink"), which is required to call the
ferryman.

Hitting Annie results in her hitting Twinsen back with her broom.
