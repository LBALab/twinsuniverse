**Leone** is a sphero working for the healing wizard
[Ker'aooc](Ker'aooc "wikilink") as his housemaid. During most of
[Twinsen's Odyssey](Twinsen's_Odyssey "wikilink") she is seen cleaning
[his house](Ker'aooc's_house "wikilink") in
[Port-Ludo](Port-Ludo "wikilink").

[Twinsen](Twinsen "wikilink") first meets Leone as a customer shopping
in the [pharmacy](pharmacy "wikilink") on [Citadel
Island](Citadel_Island "wikilink"), when she tells him she has an idea
how to help [Dino-Fly](Dino-Fly "wikilink"). Just then, her
[umbrella](umbrella "wikilink") is stolen by a
[thief](Umbrella_thief "wikilink") [rabbibunny](rabbibunny "wikilink").
Giving her back the umbrella, Twinsen learns from Leone that he can go
visit the healing wizard for assistance.

When Twinsen goes to [Desert Island](Desert_Island "wikilink") to look
for the wizard, he finds Leone in the wizard's house, where she tells
him that Ker'aooc would be gone for a while. She suggests Twinsen to
search for the [School of Magic](School_of_Magic "wikilink") in case
it's an emergency.

Twinsen can also take the [Gallic Acid](Gallic_Acid "wikilink") from
Ker'aooc's house. Leone says that he can take, as Ker'aooc doesn't use
it.
